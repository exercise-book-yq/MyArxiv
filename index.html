                                        <span>  In the past few years, text-to-audio models have emerged as a significant
advancement in automatic audio gener- ation. Although they represent impressive
technological progress, the effectiveness of their use in the development of
audio applications remains uncertain. This paper aims to investigate these
aspects, specifically focusing on the task of classification of environmental
sounds. This study analyzes the performance of two different environmental
classification systems when data generated from text-to-audio models is used
for training. Two cases are considered: a) when the training dataset is
augmented by data coming from two different text-to-audio models; and b) when
the training dataset consists solely of synthetic audio generated. In both
cases, the performance of the classification task is tested on real data.
Results indicate that text-to-audio models are effective for dataset
augmentation, whereas the performance of the models drops when relying on only
generated audio.

human-computer interaction and speech processing capabilities. We introduce a
novel deep-learning architecture designed specifically for the functional data
model known as the multiple-index functional model. Our key innovation lies in
integrating adaptive basis layers and an automated data transformation search
within the deep learning framework. Simulations for this new model show good
performances. This allows us to extract features tailored for chunk-level SER,
based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on the benchmark IEMOCAP database, achieving good
performance compared to existing methods.

                                        <span>  With the ever-rising quality of deep generative models, it is increasingly
important to be able to discern whether the audio data at hand have been
recorded or synthesized. Although the detection of fake speech signals has been
studied extensively, this is not the case for the detection of fake
environmental audio.
  We propose a simple and efficient pipeline for detecting fake environmental
sounds based on the CLAP audio embedding. We evaluate this detector using audio
data from the 2023 DCASE challenge task on Foley sound synthesis.
  Our experiments show that fake sounds generated by 44 state-of-the-art
synthesizers can be detected on average with 98% accuracy. We show that using
an audio embedding learned on environmental audio is beneficial over a standard
VGGish one as it provides a 10% increase in detection performance. Informal
listening to Incorrect Negative examples demonstrates audible features of fake
sounds missed by the detector such as distortion and implausible background
noise.

                                        <span>  Distance estimation from audio plays a crucial role in various applications,
such as acoustic scene analysis, sound source localization, and room modeling.
Most studies predominantly center on employing a classification approach, where
distances are discretized into distinct categories, enabling smoother model
training and achieving higher accuracy but imposing restrictions on the
precision of the obtained sound source position. Towards this direction, in
this paper we propose a novel approach for continuous distance estimation from
audio signals using a convolutional recurrent neural network with an attention
module. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant temporal
and spectral features, enhancing its ability to capture fine-grained
distance-related information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
method, we conduct extensive experiments using audio recordings in controlled
environments with three levels of realism (synthetic room impulse response,
measured response with convolved speech, and real recordings) on four datasets
(our synthetic dataset, QMULTIMIT, VoiceHome-2, and STARSS23). Experimental
results show that the model achieves an absolute error of 0.11 meters in a
noiseless synthetic scenario. Moreover, the results showed an absolute error of
about 1.30 meters in the hybrid scenario. The algorithm's performance in the
real scenario, where unpredictable environmental factors and noise are
prevalent, yields an absolute error of approximately 0.50 meters. For
reproducible research purposes we make model, code, and synthetic datasets
available at https://github.com/michaelneri/audio-distance-estimation.

embeddings to calculate the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) metric can help the
FAD to correlate better with perceptual ratings of environmental sounds. We
used embeddings from VGGish, PANNs, MS-CLAP, L-CLAP, and MERT, which are
tailored for either music or environmental sound evaluation. The FAD scores
were calculated for sounds from the DCASE 2023 Task 7 dataset. Using perceptual
data from the same task, we find that PANNs-WGM-LogMel produces the best
correlation between FAD scores and perceptual ratings of both audio quality and
perceived fit with a Spearman correlation higher than 0.5. We also find that
music-specific embeddings resulted in significantly lower results.
Interestingly, VGGish, the embedding used for the original Fr\'echet
calculation, yielded a correlation below 0.1. These results underscore the
critical importance of the choice of embedding for the FAD metric design.

                                        <span>  The goal of the multi-sound source localization task is to localize sound
sources from the mixture individually. While recent multi-sound source
localization methods have shown improved performance, they face challenges due
to their reliance on prior information about the number of objects to be
separated. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present a novel
multi-sound source localization method that can perform localization without
prior knowledge of the number of sound sources. To achieve this goal, we
propose an iterative object identification (IOI) module, which can recognize
sound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of
sound-making objects, we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss
to guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but
also distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our
method to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any
prior knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the MUSIC and VGGSound
benchmarks show the significant performance improvements of the proposed method
over the existing methods for both single and multi-source. Our code is

their activities. Most common indoor localization methods for human tracking
technologies require expensive infrastructures, deployment and maintenance. To
overcome this problem, environmental sounds have been used for
infrastructure-free localization. While they achieve room-level classification,
they suffer from two problems: low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) condition and
non-uniqueness of sound over the coverage area. A microphone localization
method was proposed using supervised spectral decomposition and spatial
likelihood to solve these problems. The proposed method was evaluated with
actual recordings in an experimental room with a size of 12 x 30 m. The results
showed that the proposed method with supervised NMF was robust under low-SNR
condition compared to a simple feature (mel frequency cepstrum coefficient:
MFCC). Additionally, the proposed method could be easily integrated with prior
distribution, which is available from other Bayesian localizations. The
proposed method can be used to evaluate the spatial likelihood from
environmental sounds.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a novel neural speech phase prediction model which
predicts wrapped phase spectra directly from amplitude spectra. The proposed
model is a cascade of a residual convolutional network and a parallel
estimation architecture. The parallel estimation architecture is a core module
for direct wrapped phase prediction. This architecture consists of two parallel
linear convolutional layers and a phase calculation formula, imitating the
process of calculating the phase spectra from the real and imaginary parts of
complex spectra and strictly restricting the predicted phase values to the
principal value interval. To avoid the error expansion issue caused by phase
wrapping, we design anti-wrapping training losses defined between the predicted
wrapped phase spectra and natural ones by activating the instantaneous phase
error, group delay error and instantaneous angular frequency error using an
anti-wrapping function. We mathematically demonstrate that the anti-wrapping
function should possess three properties, namely parity, periodicity and
monotonicity. We also achieve low-latency streamable phase prediction by
combining causal convolutions and knowledge distillation training strategies.
For both analysis-synthesis and specific speech generation tasks, experimental
results show that our proposed neural speech phase prediction model outperforms
the iterative phase estimation algorithms and neural network-based phase
prediction methods in terms of phase prediction precision, efficiency and
robustness. Compared with HiFi-GAN-based waveform reconstruction method, our
proposed model also shows outstanding efficiency advantages while ensuring the
quality of synthesized speech. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to directly predict speech phase spectra from amplitude spectra only via neural
networks.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of speech emotion
recognition (SER) by using vision transformer (ViT) to attend to the
correlation of frequency (y-axis) with time (x-axis) in spectrogram and
transferring positional information between ViT through knowledge transfer. The
proposed method has the following originality i) We use vertically segmented
patches of log-Mel spectrogram to analyze the correlation of frequencies over
time. This type of patch allows us to correlate the most relevant frequencies
for a particular emotion with the time they were uttered. ii) We propose the
use of image coordinate encoding, an absolute positional encoding suitable for
ViT. By normalizing the x, y coordinates of the image to -1 to 1 and
concatenating them to the image, we can effectively provide valid absolute
positional information for ViT. iii) Through feature map matching, the locality
and location information of the teacher network is effectively transmitted to
the student network. Teacher network is a ViT that contains locality of
convolutional stem and absolute position information through image coordinate
encoding, and student network is a structure that lacks positional encoding in
the basic ViT structure. In feature map matching stage, we train through the
mean absolute error (L1 loss) to minimize the difference between the feature
maps of the two networks. To validate the proposed method, three emotion
datasets (SAVEE, EmoDB, and CREMA-D) consisting of speech were converted into
log-Mel spectrograms for comparison experiments. The experimental results show
that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
in terms of weighted accuracy while requiring significantly fewer floating
point operations (FLOPs). Overall, the proposed method offers an promising
solution for SER by providing improved efficiency and performance.

sound field in a room has several impor- tant real-world applications. However,
an unpractical number of microphones is often required. Recently, in addition
to classical signal processing methods, deep learning techniques have been
applied to reconstruct the room transfer function starting from a very limited
set of measurements at scattered points in the room. In this paper, we employ
complex-valued neural networks to estimate room transfer functions in the
frequency range of the first room resonances, using a few irregularly
distributed microphones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that complex-valued neural networks are used to estimate room transfer
functions. To analyze the benefits of applying complex- valued optimization to
the considered task, we compare the proposed technique with a state-of-the-art
kernel-based signal processing approach for sound field reconstruction, showing
that the proposed technique exhibits relevant advantages in terms of phase
accuracy and overall quality of the reconstructed sound field. For informative
purposes, we also compare the model with a similarly-structured data-driven
approach that, however, applies a real-valued neural network to reconstruct
only the magnitude of the sound field.

successful conversations than those who do not. Previous research has shown
that interlocutors entrain on linguistic features in both written and spoken
monolingual domains. More recent work on code-switched communication has also
shown preliminary evidence of entrainment on certain aspects of code-switching
(CSW). However, such studies of entrainment in code-switched domains have been
extremely few and restricted to human-machine textual interactions. Our work
studies code-switched spontaneous speech between humans, finding that (1)
patterns of written and spoken entrainment in monolingual settings largely
generalize to code-switched settings, and (2) some patterns of entrainment on
code-switching in dialogue agent-generated text generalize to spontaneous
code-switched speech. Our findings give rise to important implications for the
potentially "universal" nature of entrainment as a communication phenomenon,
and potential applications in inclusive and interactive speech technology.

                                        <span>  As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using
it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for
malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today,
the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the
ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real
and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are
to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We
conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate
people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and
audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which
people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions
and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used
in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between
synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance
worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic
content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single
modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to
being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages
as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that
prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection
performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly
susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that
human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an
effective counterdefense.

sequences conditioned on given music. We design Lodge as a two-stage coarse to
fine diffusion architecture, and propose the characteristic dance primitives
that possess significant expressiveness as intermediate representations between
two diffusion models. The first stage is global diffusion, which focuses on
comprehending the coarse-level music-dance correlation and production
characteristic dance primitives. In contrast, the second-stage is the local
diffusion, which parallelly generates detailed motion sequences under the
guidance of the dance primitives and choreographic rules. In addition, we
propose a Foot Refine Block to optimize the contact between the feet and the
ground, enhancing the physical realism of the motion. Our approach can
parallelly generate dance sequences of extremely long length, striking a
balance between global choreographic patterns and local motion quality and
expressiveness. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our method.

advancement in automatic audio gener- ation. Although they represent impressive
technological progress, the effectiveness of their use in the development of
audio applications remains uncertain. This paper aims to investigate these
aspects, specifically focusing on the task of classification of environmental
sounds. This study analyzes the performance of two different environmental
classification systems when data generated from text-to-audio models is used
for training. Two cases are considered: a) when the training dataset is
augmented by data coming from two different text-to-audio models; and b) when
the training dataset consists solely of synthetic audio generated. In both
cases, the performance of the classification task is tested on real data.
Results indicate that text-to-audio models are effective for dataset
augmentation, whereas the performance of the models drops when relying on only
generated audio.

important to be able to discern whether the audio data at hand have been
recorded or synthesized. Although the detection of fake speech signals has been
studied extensively, this is not the case for the detection of fake
environmental audio.
  We propose a simple and efficient pipeline for detecting fake environmental
sounds based on the CLAP audio embedding. We evaluate this detector using audio
data from the 2023 DCASE challenge task on Foley sound synthesis.
  Our experiments show that fake sounds generated by 44 state-of-the-art
synthesizers can be detected on average with 98% accuracy. We show that using
an audio embedding learned on environmental audio is beneficial over a standard
VGGish one as it provides a 10% increase in detection performance. Informal
listening to Incorrect Negative examples demonstrates audible features of fake
sounds missed by the detector such as distortion and implausible background
noise.

                                        <span>  Distance estimation from audio plays a crucial role in various applications,
such as acoustic scene analysis, sound source localization, and room modeling.
Most studies predominantly center on employing a classification approach, where
distances are discretized into distinct categories, enabling smoother model
training and achieving higher accuracy but imposing restrictions on the
precision of the obtained sound source position. Towards this direction, in
this paper we propose a novel approach for continuous distance estimation from
audio signals using a convolutional recurrent neural network with an attention
module. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant temporal
and spectral features, enhancing its ability to capture fine-grained
distance-related information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
method, we conduct extensive experiments using audio recordings in controlled
environments with three levels of realism (synthetic room impulse response,
measured response with convolved speech, and real recordings) on four datasets
(our synthetic dataset, QMULTIMIT, VoiceHome-2, and STARSS23). Experimental
results show that the model achieves an absolute error of 0.11 meters in a
noiseless synthetic scenario. Moreover, the results showed an absolute error of
about 1.30 meters in the hybrid scenario. The algorithm's performance in the
real scenario, where unpredictable environmental factors and noise are
prevalent, yields an absolute error of approximately 0.50 meters. For
reproducible research purposes we make model, code, and synthetic datasets

                                        <span>  This paper explores whether considering alternative domain-specific
embeddings to calculate the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) metric can help the
FAD to correlate better with perceptual ratings of environmental sounds. We
used embeddings from VGGish, PANNs, MS-CLAP, L-CLAP, and MERT, which are
tailored for either music or environmental sound evaluation. The FAD scores
were calculated for sounds from the DCASE 2023 Task 7 dataset. Using perceptual
data from the same task, we find that PANNs-WGM-LogMel produces the best
correlation between FAD scores and perceptual ratings of both audio quality and
perceived fit with a Spearman correlation higher than 0.5. We also find that
music-specific embeddings resulted in significantly lower results.
Interestingly, VGGish, the embedding used for the original Fr\'echet
calculation, yielded a correlation below 0.1. These results underscore the
critical importance of the choice of embedding for the FAD metric design.

                                        <span>  The goal of the multi-sound source localization task is to localize sound
sources from the mixture individually. While recent multi-sound source
localization methods have shown improved performance, they face challenges due
to their reliance on prior information about the number of objects to be
separated. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present a novel
multi-sound source localization method that can perform localization without
prior knowledge of the number of sound sources. To achieve this goal, we
propose an iterative object identification (IOI) module, which can recognize
sound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of
sound-making objects, we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss
to guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but
also distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our
method to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any
prior knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the MUSIC and VGGSound
benchmarks show the significant performance improvements of the proposed method
over the existing methods for both single and multi-source. Our code is

their activities. Most common indoor localization methods for human tracking
technologies require expensive infrastructures, deployment and maintenance. To
overcome this problem, environmental sounds have been used for
infrastructure-free localization. While they achieve room-level classification,
they suffer from two problems: low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) condition and
non-uniqueness of sound over the coverage area. A microphone localization
method was proposed using supervised spectral decomposition and spatial
likelihood to solve these problems. The proposed method was evaluated with
actual recordings in an experimental room with a size of 12 x 30 m. The results
showed that the proposed method with supervised NMF was robust under low-SNR
condition compared to a simple feature (mel frequency cepstrum coefficient:
MFCC). Additionally, the proposed method could be easily integrated with prior
distribution, which is available from other Bayesian localizations. The
proposed method can be used to evaluate the spatial likelihood from
environmental sounds.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a novel neural speech phase prediction model which
predicts wrapped phase spectra directly from amplitude spectra. The proposed
model is a cascade of a residual convolutional network and a parallel
estimation architecture. The parallel estimation architecture is a core module
for direct wrapped phase prediction. This architecture consists of two parallel
linear convolutional layers and a phase calculation formula, imitating the
process of calculating the phase spectra from the real and imaginary parts of
complex spectra and strictly restricting the predicted phase values to the
principal value interval. To avoid the error expansion issue caused by phase
wrapping, we design anti-wrapping training losses defined between the predicted
wrapped phase spectra and natural ones by activating the instantaneous phase
error, group delay error and instantaneous angular frequency error using an
anti-wrapping function. We mathematically demonstrate that the anti-wrapping
function should possess three properties, namely parity, periodicity and
monotonicity. We also achieve low-latency streamable phase prediction by
combining causal convolutions and knowledge distillation training strategies.
For both analysis-synthesis and specific speech generation tasks, experimental
results show that our proposed neural speech phase prediction model outperforms
the iterative phase estimation algorithms and neural network-based phase
prediction methods in terms of phase prediction precision, efficiency and
robustness. Compared with HiFi-GAN-based waveform reconstruction method, our
proposed model also shows outstanding efficiency advantages while ensuring the
quality of synthesized speech. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to directly predict speech phase spectra from amplitude spectra only via neural
networks.

recognition (SER) by using vision transformer (ViT) to attend to the
correlation of frequency (y-axis) with time (x-axis) in spectrogram and
transferring positional information between ViT through knowledge transfer. The
proposed method has the following originality i) We use vertically segmented
patches of log-Mel spectrogram to analyze the correlation of frequencies over
time. This type of patch allows us to correlate the most relevant frequencies
for a particular emotion with the time they were uttered. ii) We propose the
use of image coordinate encoding, an absolute positional encoding suitable for
ViT. By normalizing the x, y coordinates of the image to -1 to 1 and
concatenating them to the image, we can effectively provide valid absolute
positional information for ViT. iii) Through feature map matching, the locality
and location information of the teacher network is effectively transmitted to
the student network. Teacher network is a ViT that contains locality of
convolutional stem and absolute position information through image coordinate
encoding, and student network is a structure that lacks positional encoding in
the basic ViT structure. In feature map matching stage, we train through the
mean absolute error (L1 loss) to minimize the difference between the feature
maps of the two networks. To validate the proposed method, three emotion
datasets (SAVEE, EmoDB, and CREMA-D) consisting of speech were converted into
log-Mel spectrograms for comparison experiments. The experimental results show
that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
in terms of weighted accuracy while requiring significantly fewer floating
point operations (FLOPs). Overall, the proposed method offers an promising
solution for SER by providing improved efficiency and performance.

sound field in a room has several impor- tant real-world applications. However,
an unpractical number of microphones is often required. Recently, in addition
to classical signal processing methods, deep learning techniques have been
applied to reconstruct the room transfer function starting from a very limited
set of measurements at scattered points in the room. In this paper, we employ
complex-valued neural networks to estimate room transfer functions in the
frequency range of the first room resonances, using a few irregularly
distributed microphones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that complex-valued neural networks are used to estimate room transfer
functions. To analyze the benefits of applying complex- valued optimization to
the considered task, we compare the proposed technique with a state-of-the-art
kernel-based signal processing approach for sound field reconstruction, showing
that the proposed technique exhibits relevant advantages in terms of phase
accuracy and overall quality of the reconstructed sound field. For informative
purposes, we also compare the model with a similarly-structured data-driven
approach that, however, applies a real-valued neural network to reconstruct
only the magnitude of the sound field.

                                        <span>  It is well-known that speakers who entrain to one another have more
successful conversations than those who do not. Previous research has shown
that interlocutors entrain on linguistic features in both written and spoken
monolingual domains. More recent work on code-switched communication has also
shown preliminary evidence of entrainment on certain aspects of code-switching
(CSW). However, such studies of entrainment in code-switched domains have been
extremely few and restricted to human-machine textual interactions. Our work
studies code-switched spontaneous speech between humans, finding that (1)
patterns of written and spoken entrainment in monolingual settings largely
generalize to code-switched settings, and (2) some patterns of entrainment on
code-switching in dialogue agent-generated text generalize to spontaneous
code-switched speech. Our findings give rise to important implications for the
potentially "universal" nature of entrainment as a communication phenomenon,
and potential applications in inclusive and interactive speech technology.

                                        <span>  As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using
it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for
malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today,
the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the
ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real
and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are
to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We
conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate
people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and
audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which
people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions
and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used
in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between
synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance
worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic
content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single
modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to
being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages
as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that
prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection
performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly
susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that
human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an
effective counterdefense.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel direct Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech
Translation (AV2AV) framework, where the input and output of the system are
multimodal (i.e., audio and visual speech). With the proposed AV2AV, two key
advantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations with
individuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primary
languages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A), which solely
translates between audio modalities, the proposed AV2AV directly translates
between audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experience
by presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2)
We can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. By
employing the complementary information of audio-visual speech, the system can
effectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise,
showcasing robust performance. To mitigate the problem of the absence of a
parallel AV2AV translation dataset, we propose to train our spoken language
translation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A. This is done by learning
unified audio-visual speech representations through self-supervised learning in
advance to train the translation system. Moreover, we propose an AV-Renderer
that can generate raw audio and video in parallel. It is designed with
zero-shot speaker modeling, thus the speaker in source audio-visual speech can
be maintained at the target translated audio-visual speech. The effectiveness
of AV2AV is evaluated with extensive experiments in a many-to-many language
translation setting. Demo page is available on

                                        <span>  Interactions with virtual assistants typically start with a predefined
trigger phrase followed by the user command. To make interactions with the
assistant more intuitive, we explore whether it is feasible to drop the
requirement that users must begin each command with a trigger phrase. We
explore this task in three ways: First, we train classifiers using only
acoustic information obtained from the audio waveform. Second, we take the
decoder outputs of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, such as 1-best
hypotheses, as input features to a large language model (LLM). Finally, we
explore a multimodal system that combines acoustic and lexical features, as
well as ASR decoder signals in an LLM. Using multimodal information yields
relative equal-error-rate improvements over text-only and audio-only models of
up to 39% and 61%. Increasing the size of the LLM and training with low-rank
adaption leads to further relative EER reductions of up to 18% on our dataset.

sequences conditioned on given music. We design Lodge as a two-stage coarse to
fine diffusion architecture, and propose the characteristic dance primitives
that possess significant expressiveness as intermediate representations between
two diffusion models. The first stage is global diffusion, which focuses on
comprehending the coarse-level music-dance correlation and production
characteristic dance primitives. In contrast, the second-stage is the local
diffusion, which parallelly generates detailed motion sequences under the
guidance of the dance primitives and choreographic rules. In addition, we
propose a Foot Refine Block to optimize the contact between the feet and the
ground, enhancing the physical realism of the motion. Our approach can
parallelly generate dance sequences of extremely long length, striking a
balance between global choreographic patterns and local motion quality and
expressiveness. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our method.

                                        <span>  Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown promising results for
semi-supervised video object segmentation. However, these approaches typically
struggle on long videos due to increased GPU memory demands, as they frequently
expand the memory bank every few frames. We propose a transformer-based
approach, named MAVOS, that introduces an optimized and dynamic long-term
modulated cross-attention (MCA) memory to model temporal smoothness without
requiring frequent memory expansion. The proposed MCA effectively encodes both
local and global features at various levels of granularity while efficiently
maintaining consistent speed regardless of the video length. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks, LVOS, Long-Time Video, and DAVIS 2017,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contributions leading to
real-time inference and markedly reduced memory demands without any degradation
in segmentation accuracy on long videos. Compared to the best existing
transformer-based approach, our MAVOS increases the speed by 7.6x, while
significantly reducing the GPU memory by 87% with comparable segmentation
performance on short and long video datasets. Notably on the LVOS dataset, our
MAVOS achieves a J&F score of 63.3% while operating at 37 frames per second
(FPS) on a single V100 GPU. Our code and models will be publicly available at:

                                        <span>  Gestures play a key role in human communication. Recent methods for co-speech
gesture generation, while managing to generate beat-aligned motions, struggle
generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance. Compared
to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal, semantically
coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the
language and human motion, and can be controlled by focusing on certain words.
Therefore, we present ConvoFusion, a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal
gesture synthesis, which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal
speech inputs, but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis.
Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate
the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as
to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing. Our method is
versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or
even the conversational gestures. To further advance the research on
multi-party interactive gestures, the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released,
which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one
another. We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate
effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks. We urge the reader to watch
our supplementary video at our website.

                                        <span>  The core of video understanding tasks, such as recognition, captioning, and
tracking, is to automatically detect objects or actions in a video and analyze
their temporal evolution. Despite sharing a common goal, different tasks often
rely on distinct model architectures and annotation formats. In contrast,
natural language processing benefits from a unified output space, i.e., text
sequences, which simplifies the training of powerful foundational language
models, such as GPT-3, with extensive training corpora. Inspired by this, we
seek to unify the output space of video understanding tasks by using languages
as labels and additionally introducing time and box tokens. In this way, a
variety of video tasks could be formulated as video-grounded token generation.
This enables us to address various types of video tasks, including
classification (such as action recognition), captioning (covering clip
captioning, video question answering, and dense video captioning), and
localization tasks (such as visual object tracking) within a fully shared
encoder-decoder architecture, following a generative framework. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate such a simple and straightforward
idea is quite effective and can achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results
on seven video benchmarks, providing a novel perspective for more universal
video understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/wangjk666/OmniVid.

                                        <span>  Expressive human pose and shape estimation (a.k.a. 3D whole-body mesh
recovery) involves the human body, hand, and expression estimation. Most
existing methods have tackled this task in a two-stage manner, first detecting
the human body part with an off-the-shelf detection model and inferring the
different human body parts individually. Despite the impressive results
achieved, these methods suffer from 1) loss of valuable contextual information
via cropping, 2) introducing distractions, and 3) lacking inter-association
among different persons and body parts, inevitably causing performance
degradation, especially for crowded scenes. To address these issues, we
introduce a novel all-in-one-stage framework, AiOS, for multiple expressive
human pose and shape recovery without an additional human detection step.
Specifically, our method is built upon DETR, which treats multi-person
whole-body mesh recovery task as a progressive set prediction problem with
various sequential detection. We devise the decoder tokens and extend them to
our task. Specifically, we first employ a human token to probe a human location
in the image and encode global features for each instance, which provides a
coarse location for the later transformer block. Then, we introduce a
joint-related token to probe the human joint in the image and encoder a
fine-grained local feature, which collaborates with the global feature to
regress the whole-body mesh. This straightforward but effective model
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a 9% reduction in NMVE on
AGORA, a 30% reduction in PVE on EHF, a 10% reduction in PVE on ARCTIC, and a
3% reduction in PVE on EgoBody.

to generate agent bounding boxes and lane graphs. The model's outputs serve as
an initial state for traffic simulation. The unique properties of the entities
to be generated for SLEDGE, such as their connectivity and variable count per
scene, render the naive application of most modern generative models to this
task non-trivial. Therefore, together with a systematic study of existing lane
graph representations, we introduce a novel raster-to-vector autoencoder
(RVAE). It encodes agents and the lane graph into distinct channels in a
rasterized latent map. This facilitates both lane-conditioned agent generation
and combined generation of lanes and agents with a Diffusion Transformer. Using
generated entities in SLEDGE enables greater control over the simulation, e.g.
upsampling turns or increasing traffic density. Further, SLEDGE can support
500m long routes, a capability not found in existing data-driven simulators
like nuPlan. It presents new challenges for planning algorithms, evidenced by
failure rates of over 40% for PDM, the winner of the 2023 nuPlan challenge,
when tested on hard routes and dense traffic generated by our model. Compared
to nuPlan, SLEDGE requires 500$\times$ less storage to set up (<4GB), making it
a more accessible option and helping with democratizing future research in this

optimization-based tracking technique, OmniMotion, requires a prohibitively
long optimization time, rendering it impractical for downstream applications.
OmniMotion is sensitive to the choice of random seeds, leading to unstable
convergence. To improve efficiency and robustness, we introduce a novel
invertible deformation network, CaDeX++, which factorizes the function
representation into a local spatial-temporal feature grid and enhances the
expressivity of the coupling blocks with non-linear functions. While CaDeX++
incorporates a stronger geometric bias within its architectural design, it also
takes advantage of the inductive bias provided by the vision foundation models.
Our system utilizes monocular depth estimation to represent scene geometry and
enhances the objective by incorporating DINOv2 long-term semantics to regulate
the optimization process. Our experiments demonstrate a substantial improvement
in training speed (more than \textbf{10 times} faster), robustness, and
accuracy in tracking over the SoTA optimization-based method OmniMotion.

                                        <span>  Hypercomplex neural networks are gaining increasing interest in the deep
learning community. The attention directed towards hypercomplex models
originates from several aspects, spanning from purely theoretical and
mathematical characteristics to the practical advantage of lightweight models
over conventional networks, and their unique properties to capture both global
and local relations. In particular, a branch of these architectures,
parameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs), has also gained popularity
due to their versatility across a multitude of application domains.
Nonetheless, only few attempts have been made to explain or interpret their
intricacies. In this paper, we propose inherently interpretable PHNNs and
quaternion-like networks, thus without the need for any post-hoc method. To
achieve this, we define a type of cosine-similarity transform within the
parameterized hypercomplex domain. This PHB-cos transform induces weight
alignment with relevant input features and allows to reduce the model into a
single linear transform, rendering it directly interpretable. In this work, we
start to draw insights into how this unique branch of neural models operates.
We observe that hypercomplex networks exhibit a tendency to concentrate on the
shape around the main object of interest, in addition to the shape of the
object itself. We provide a thorough analysis, studying single neurons of
different layers and comparing them against how real-valued networks learn. The

                                        <span>  FastCAR is a novel task consolidation approach in Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
for a classification and a regression task, despite task heterogeneity with
only subtle correlation. It addresses object classification and continuous
property variable regression, a crucial use case in science and engineering.
FastCAR involves a labeling transformation approach that can be used with a
single-task regression network architecture. FastCAR outperforms traditional
MTL model families, parametrized in the landscape of architecture and loss
weighting schemes, when learning of both tasks are collectively considered
(classification accuracy of 99.54%, regression mean absolute percentage error
of 2.3%). The experiments performed used an Advanced Steel Property dataset
contributed by us. The dataset comprises 4536 images of 224x224 pixels,
annotated with object classes and hardness properties that take continuous
values. With the labeling transformation and single-task regression network
architecture, FastCAR achieves reduced latency and time efficiency.

aiding image interpolation. Interpolation in latent spaces is well-studied, but
interpolation with specific conditions like text or poses is less understood.
Simple approaches, such as linear interpolation in the space of conditions,
often result in images that lack consistency, smoothness, and fidelity. To that
end, we introduce a novel training-free technique named Attention Interpolation
via Diffusion (AID). Our key contributions include 1) proposing an inner/outer
interpolated attention layer; 2) fusing the interpolated attention with
self-attention to boost fidelity; and 3) applying beta distribution to
selection to increase smoothness. We also present a variant, Prompt-guided
Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (PAID), that considers interpolation as a
condition-dependent generative process. This method enables the creation of new
images with greater consistency, smoothness, and efficiency, and offers control
over the exact path of interpolation. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness
for conceptual and spatial interpolation. Code and demo are available at

                                        <span>  Recent techniques for text-to-4D generation synthesize dynamic 3D scenes
using supervision from pre-trained text-to-video models. However, existing
representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural
representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they
cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume
rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in
realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video
generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D
generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent
the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a
trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform
to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our
approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories,
compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and
amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user
study. Video results can be viewed on our website:

maturity of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has enabled the
capability of cooperative connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Building on
top of cooperative perception, this paper explores the feasibility and
effectiveness of cooperative motion prediction. Our method, CMP, takes LiDAR
signals as input to enhance tracking and prediction capabilities. Unlike
previous work that focuses separately on either cooperative perception or
motion prediction, our framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to
address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and
prediction modules. Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to
tolerate realistic V2X bandwidth limitations and transmission delays, while
dealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction
aggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs
and generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation
studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative
perception, tracking, and motion prediction tasks. In particular, CMP reduces
the average prediction error by 17.2\% with fewer missing detections compared
with the no cooperation setting. Our work marks a significant step forward in
the cooperative capabilities of CAVs, showcasing enhanced performance in
complex scenarios.

robotic surgery to obtain better coverage of the organ and detection of various
health issues. Despite promising progress on mainstream, natural image depth
estimation, techniques perform poorly on endoscopy images due to a lack of
strong geometric features and challenging illumination effects. In this paper,
we utilize the photometric cues, i.e., the light emitted from an endoscope and
reflected by the surface, to improve monocular depth estimation. We first
create two novel loss functions with supervised and self-supervised variants
that utilize a per-pixel shading representation. We then propose a novel depth
refinement network (PPSNet) that leverages the same per-pixel shading
representation. Finally, we introduce teacher-student transfer learning to
produce better depth maps from both synthetic data with supervision and
clinical data with self-supervision. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the
C3VD dataset while estimating high-quality depth maps from clinical data. Our

                                        <span>  Deep learning has shown remarkable success in remote sensing change detection
(CD), aiming to identify semantic change regions between co-registered
satellite image pairs acquired at distinct time stamps. However, existing
convolutional neural network and transformer-based frameworks often struggle to
accurately segment semantic change regions. Moreover, transformers-based
methods with standard self-attention suffer from quadratic computational
complexity with respect to the image resolution, making them less practical for
CD tasks with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose an
efficient change detection framework, ELGC-Net, which leverages rich contextual
information to precisely estimate change regions while reducing the model size.
Our ELGC-Net comprises a Siamese encoder, fusion modules, and a decoder. The
focus of our design is the introduction of an Efficient Local-Global Context
Aggregator module within the encoder, capturing enhanced global context and
local spatial information through a novel pooled-transpose (PT) attention and
depthwise convolution, respectively. The PT attention employs pooling
operations for robust feature extraction and minimizes computational cost with
transposed attention. Extensive experiments on three challenging CD datasets
demonstrate that ELGC-Net outperforms existing methods. Compared to the recent
transformer-based CD approach (ChangeFormer), ELGC-Net achieves a 1.4% gain in
intersection over union metric on the LEVIR-CD dataset, while significantly
reducing trainable parameters. Our proposed ELGC-Net sets a new
state-of-the-art performance in remote sensing change detection benchmarks.
Finally, we also introduce ELGC-Net-LW, a lighter variant with significantly
reduced computational complexity, suitable for resource-constrained settings,
while achieving comparable performance. Project url

                                        <span>  We propose a new approach for non-Cartesian magnetic resonance image
reconstruction. While unrolled architectures provide robustness via
data-consistency layers, embedding measurement operators in Deep Neural Network
(DNN) can become impractical at large scale. Alternative Plug-and-Play (PnP)
approaches, where the denoising DNNs are blind to the measurement setting, are
not affected by this limitation and have also proven effective, but their
highly iterative nature also affects scalability. To address this scalability
challenge, we leverage the "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic
range imaging (R2D2)" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging.
R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively
estimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and
associated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned
version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation,
considering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary
results suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its
unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the
necessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior
reconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based
approximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to
PnP, while only requiring few iterations.

                                        <span>  The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration
architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and
various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters are inherently
local and therefore struggle at modeling long-range dependencies in images. On
the other hand, attention excels at capturing global interactions between
arbitrary image regions, however at a quadratic cost in image dimension. In
this work, we propose Serpent, an architecture that leverages recent advances
in state space models (SSMs) in its core computational block. SSMs, originally
introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a
favorable linear scaling in input size. Our preliminary results demonstrate
that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art
techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold
reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while
maintaining a compact model size.

                                        <span>  The recent 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has shown remarkable rendering
fidelity and efficiency compared to NeRF-based neural scene representations.
While demonstrating the potential for real-time rendering, 3D-GS encounters
rendering bottlenecks in large scenes with complex details due to an excessive
number of Gaussian primitives located within the viewing frustum. This
limitation is particularly noticeable in zoom-out views and can lead to
inconsistent rendering speeds in scenes with varying details. Moreover, it
often struggles to capture the corresponding level of details at different
scales with its heuristic density control operation. Inspired by the
Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce Octree-GS, featuring an
LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition
for scene representation that contributes to the final rendering results. Our
model dynamically selects the appropriate level from the set of
multi-resolution anchor points, ensuring consistent rendering performance with
adaptive LOD adjustments while maintaining high-fidelity rendering results.

gained vast popularity in recent years because of its wide range of
applications in sectors like XR-technologies, human-computer interaction, and
fitness tracking. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic
literature review based on the proposed solutions regarding egocentric 3D human

extensive overview of the current state of egocentric pose estimation research.
In this paper, we categorize and discuss the popular datasets and the different
pose estimation models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different
methods by comparative analysis. This survey can be a valuable resource for
both researchers and practitioners in the field, offering insights into key
concepts and cutting-edge solutions in egocentric pose estimation, its
wide-ranging applications, as well as the open problems with future scope.

                                        <span>  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized radiance field
reconstruction, achieving high quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering
speed without baking. However, 3DGS fails to accurately represent surfaces due
to the multi-view inconsistent nature of 3D Gaussians. We present 2D Gaussian
Splatting (2DGS), a novel approach to model and reconstruct geometrically
accurate radiance fields from multi-view images. Our key idea is to collapse
the 3D volume into a set of 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks. Unlike 3D
Gaussians, 2D Gaussians provide view-consistent geometry while modeling
surfaces intrinsically. To accurately recover thin surfaces and achieve stable
optimization, we introduce a perspective-accurate 2D splatting process
utilizing ray-splat intersection and rasterization. Additionally, we
incorporate depth distortion and normal consistency terms to further enhance
the quality of the reconstructions. We demonstrate that our differentiable
renderer allows for noise-free and detailed geometry reconstruction while
maintaining competitive appearance quality, fast training speed, and real-time
rendering. Our code will be made publicly available.

potential for practical applications. To advance the development of machine
learning algorithms in this domain, our study introduces the \textit{Sen2Fire}
dataset--a challenging satellite remote sensing dataset tailored for wildfire
detection. This dataset is curated from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data and
Sentinel-5P aerosol product, comprising a total of 2466 image patches. Each
patch has a size of 512$\times$512 pixels with 13 bands. Given the distinctive
sensitivities of various wavebands to wildfire responses, our research focuses
on optimizing wildfire detection by evaluating different wavebands and
employing a combination of spectral indices, such as normalized burn ratio
(NBR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results suggest
that, in contrast to using all bands for wildfire detection, selecting specific
band combinations yields superior performance. Additionally, our study
underscores the positive impact of integrating Sentinel-5 aerosol data for

intricate real-world ones. Moreover, efficiency is also an important concern in
deployment. To comprehensively address these issues, we introduce SuperFace, a
teacher-student framework that balances quality, robustness, cost and
editability. We first propose a simple but effective teacher model capable of
handling inputs of varying qualities to generate high-quality results. Building
on this, we devise an efficient distillation strategy to acquire an
identity-specific student model that maintains quality with significantly
reduced computational load. Our experiments validate that SuperFace offers a
more comprehensive solution than existing methods for the four mentioned
objectives, especially in reducing FLOPs by 99\% with the student model.
SuperFace can be driven by both video and audio and allows for localized facial
attributes editing.

detection technologies need to continuously evolve to regulate the potential
misuse of deepfakes, such as for privacy invasion and phishing attacks. This
survey comprehensively reviews the latest developments in deepfake generation

rapidly evolving field. We first unify task definitions, comprehensively
introduce datasets and metrics, and discuss the development of generation and
detection technology frameworks. Then, we discuss the development of several
related sub-fields and focus on researching four mainstream deepfake fields:
popular face swap, face reenactment, talking face generation, and facial
attribute editing, as well as foreign detection. Subsequently, we
comprehensively benchmark representative methods on popular datasets for each
field, fully evaluating the latest and influential works published in top
conferences/journals. Finally, we analyze the challenges and future research

                                        <span>  The rise of new video modalities like virtual reality or autonomous driving
has increased the demand for efficient multi-view video compression methods,
both in terms of rate-distortion (R-D) performance and in terms of delay and
runtime. While most recent stereo video compression approaches have shown
promising performance, they compress left and right views sequentially, leading
to poor parallelization and runtime performance. This work presents Low-Latency
neural codec for Stereo video Streaming (LLSS), a novel parallel stereo video
coding method designed for fast and efficient low-latency stereo video
streaming. Instead of using a sequential cross-view motion compensation like
existing methods, LLSS introduces a bidirectional feature shifting module to
directly exploit mutual information among views and encode them effectively
with a joint cross-view prior model for entropy coding. Thanks to this design,
LLSS processes left and right views in parallel, minimizing latency; all while
substantially improving R-D performance compared to both existing neural and
conventional codecs.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have recently brought a powerful revolution in image
generation. Despite showing impressive generative capabilities, most of these
models rely on the current sample to denoise the next one, possibly resulting
in denoising instability. In this paper, we reinterpret the iterative denoising
process as model optimization and leverage a moving average mechanism to
ensemble all the prior samples. Instead of simply applying moving average to
the denoised samples at different timesteps, we first map the denoised samples
to data space and then perform moving average to avoid distribution shift
across timesteps. In view that diffusion models evolve the recovery from
low-frequency components to high-frequency details, we further decompose the
samples into different frequency components and execute moving average
separately on each component. We name the complete approach "Moving Average
Sampling in Frequency domain (MASF)". MASF could be seamlessly integrated into
mainstream pre-trained diffusion models and sampling schedules. Extensive
experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models demonstrate
that our MASF leads to superior performances compared to the baselines, with
almost negligible additional complexity cost.

                                        <span>  Transfer learning has long been a key factor in the advancement of many
fields including 2D image analysis. Unfortunately, its applicability in 3D data
processing has been relatively limited. While several approaches for 3D
transfer learning have been proposed in recent literature, with contrastive
learning gaining particular prominence, most existing methods in this domain
have only been studied and evaluated in limited scenarios. Most importantly,
there is currently a lack of principled understanding of both when and why 3D
transfer learning methods are applicable. Remarkably, even the applicability of
standard supervised pre-training is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct
the first in-depth quantitative and qualitative investigation of supervised and
contrastive pre-training strategies and their utility in downstream 3D tasks.
We demonstrate that layer-wise analysis of learned features provides
significant insight into the downstream utility of trained networks. Informed
by this analysis, we propose a simple geometric regularization strategy, which
improves the transferability of supervised pre-training. Our work thus sheds
light onto both the specific challenges of 3D transfer learning, as well as
strategies to overcome them.

pre-trained visual-language features. While these maps allow for the prediction
of point-wise saliency maps when queried for a certain language concept,
large-scale environments and abstract queries beyond the object level still
pose a considerable hurdle, ultimately limiting language-grounded robotic
navigation. In this work, we present HOV-SG, a hierarchical open-vocabulary 3D
scene graph mapping approach for language-grounded robot navigation. Leveraging
open-vocabulary vision foundation models, we first obtain state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary segment-level maps in 3D and subsequently construct a 3D scene
graph hierarchy consisting of floor, room, and object concepts, each enriched
with open-vocabulary features. Our approach is able to represent multi-story
buildings and allows robotic traversal of those using a cross-floor Voronoi
graph. HOV-SG is evaluated on three distinct datasets and surpasses previous
baselines in open-vocabulary semantic accuracy on the object, room, and floor
level while producing a 75% reduction in representation size compared to dense
open-vocabulary maps. In order to prove the efficacy and generalization
capabilities of HOV-SG, we showcase successful long-horizon
language-conditioned robot navigation within real-world multi-storage
environments. We provide code and trial video data at http://hovsg.github.io/.

success on the interpretation of complex visual-language tasks. However, the
quadratic computation cost makes it resource-consuming in capturing long-range
visual-language dependencies. Fortunately, Mamba addresses this with efficient
linear complexity in processing. However, directly applying Mamba to
multi-modal interactions presents challenges, primarily due to inadequate
channel interactions for the effective fusion of multi-modal data. In this
paper, we propose ReMamber, a novel RIS architecture that integrates the power
of Mamba with a multi-modal Mamba Twister block. The Mamba Twister explicitly
models image-text interaction, and fuses textual and visual features through
its unique channel and spatial twisting mechanism. We achieve the
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct thorough
analyses of ReMamber and discuss other fusion designs using Mamba. These
provide valuable perspectives for future research.

                                        <span>  High Dynamic Range (HDR) content (i.e., images and videos) has a broad range
of applications. However, capturing HDR content from real-world scenes is
expensive and time- consuming. Therefore, the challenging task of
reconstructing visually accurate HDR images from their Low Dynamic Range (LDR)
counterparts is gaining attention in the vision research community. A major
challenge in this research problem is the lack of datasets, which capture
diverse scene conditions (e.g., lighting, shadows, weather, locations,
landscapes, objects, humans, buildings) and various image features (e.g.,
color, contrast, saturation, hue, luminance, brightness, radiance). To address
this gap, in this paper, we introduce GTA-HDR, a large-scale synthetic dataset
of photo-realistic HDR images sampled from the GTA-V video game. We perform
thorough evaluation of the proposed dataset, which demonstrates significant
qualitative and quantitative improvements of the state-of-the-art HDR image
reconstruction methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed dataset and its impact on additional computer vision tasks including
3D human pose estimation, human body part segmentation, and holistic scene
segmentation. The dataset, data collection pipeline, and evaluation code are

of comprehensive datasets. Addressing this issue, our study introduces CT-RATE,
the first 3D medical imaging dataset that pairs images with textual reports.
CT-RATE consists of 25,692 non-contrast chest CT volumes, expanded to 50,188
through various reconstructions, from 21,304 unique patients, along with
corresponding radiology text reports. Leveraging CT-RATE, we developed CT-CLIP,
a CT-focused contrastive language-image pre-training framework. As a versatile,
self-supervised model, CT-CLIP is designed for broad application and does not
require task-specific training. Remarkably, CT-CLIP outperforms
state-of-the-art, fully supervised methods in multi-abnormality detection
across all key metrics, thus eliminating the need for manual annotation. We
also demonstrate its utility in case retrieval, whether using imagery or
textual queries, thereby advancing knowledge dissemination. The open-source
release of CT-RATE and CT-CLIP marks a significant advancement in medical AI,
enhancing 3D imaging analysis and fostering innovation in healthcare.

                                        <span>  Generating natural hand-object interactions in 3D is challenging as the
resulting hand and object motions are expected to be physically plausible and
semantically meaningful. Furthermore, generalization to unseen objects is
hindered by the limited scale of available hand-object interaction datasets. We
propose DiffH2O, a novel method to synthesize realistic, one or two-handed
object interactions from provided text prompts and geometry of the object. The
method introduces three techniques that enable effective learning from limited
data. First, we decompose the task into a grasping stage and a text-based
interaction stage and use separate diffusion models for each. In the grasping
stage, the model only generates hand motions, whereas in the interaction phase
both hand and object poses are synthesized. Second, we propose a compact
representation that tightly couples hand and object poses. Third, we propose
two different guidance schemes to allow more control of the generated motions:
grasp guidance and detailed textual guidance. Grasp guidance takes a single
target grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach this grasp at the
end of the grasping stage, which provides control over the grasping pose. Given
a grasping motion from this stage, multiple different actions can be prompted
in the interaction phase. For textual guidance, we contribute comprehensive
text descriptions to the GRAB dataset and show that they enable our method to
have more fine-grained control over hand-object interactions. Our quantitative
and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms
baseline methods and leads to natural hand-object motions. Moreover, we
demonstrate the practicality of our framework by utilizing a hand pose estimate
from an off-the-shelf pose estimator for guidance, and then sampling multiple
different actions in the interaction stage.

literature, particularly following the introduction of Masked autoencoders
(MAE). Current efforts attempt to learn object-centric representations from
motion in videos. In particular, SiamMAE recently introduced a Siamese network,
training a shared-weight encoder from two frames of a video with a high
asymmetric masking ratio (95%). In this work, we propose CropMAE, an
alternative approach to the Siamese pre-training introduced by SiamMAE. Our
method specifically differs by exclusively considering pairs of cropped images
sourced from the same image but cropped differently, deviating from the
conventional pairs of frames extracted from a video. CropMAE therefore
alleviates the need for video datasets, while maintaining competitive
performances and drastically reducing pre-training time. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that CropMAE learns similar object-centric representations without
explicit motion, showing that current self-supervised learning methods do not
learn objects from motion, but rather thanks to the Siamese architecture.
Finally, CropMAE achieves the highest masking ratio to date (98.5%), enabling
the reconstruction of images using only two visible patches. Our code is
available at https://github.com/alexandre-eymael/CropMAE.

achieved state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results with high rendering
speeds and relatively low training times. However, its performance on scenes
commonly seen in indoor datasets is poor due to the lack of geometric
constraints during optimization. We extend 3D Gaussian splatting with depth and
normal cues to tackle challenging indoor datasets and showcase techniques for
efficient mesh extraction, an important downstream application. Specifically,
we regularize the optimization procedure with depth information, enforce local
smoothness of nearby Gaussians, and use the geometry of the 3D Gaussians
supervised by normal cues to achieve better alignment with the true scene
geometry. We improve depth estimation and novel view synthesis results over
baselines and show how this simple yet effective regularization technique can
be used to directly extract meshes from the Gaussian representation yielding
more physically accurate reconstructions on indoor scenes. Our code will be

                                        <span>  The segmentation and tracking of living cells play a vital role within the
biomedical domain, particularly in cancer research, drug development, and
developmental biology. These are usually tedious and time-consuming tasks that
are traditionally done by biomedical experts. Recently, to automatize these
processes, deep learning based segmentation and tracking methods have been
proposed. These methods require large-scale datasets and their full potential
is constrained by the scarcity of annotated data in the biomedical imaging
domain. To address this limitation, we propose Biomedical Video Diffusion Model
(BVDM), capable of generating realistic-looking synthetic microscopy videos.
Trained only on a single real video, BVDM can generate videos of arbitrary
length with pixel-level annotations that can be used for training data-hungry
models. It is composed of a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)
generating high-fidelity synthetic cell microscopy images and a flow prediction
model (FPM) predicting the non-rigid transformation between consecutive video
frames. During inference, initially, the DDPM imposes realistic cell textures
on synthetic cell masks which are generated based on real data statistics. The
flow prediction model predicts the flow field between consecutive masks and
applies that to the DDPM output from the previous time frame to create the next
one while keeping temporal consistency. BVDM outperforms state-of-the-art
synthetic live cell microscopy video generation models. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a sufficiently large synthetic dataset enhances the
performance of cell segmentation and tracking models compared to using a
limited amount of available real data.

plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically
appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still
struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt,
oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes
properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from
the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2)
they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by
unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and
prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and
introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a
large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models.
Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised
prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive
validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost
the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while
preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data.
Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by
harnessing the power of LLMs.

objects based on measurements by miniature, energy-efficient, low-cost
single-photon cameras. These cameras, operating as time resolved image sensors,
illuminate the scene with a very fast pulse of diffuse light and record the
shape of that pulse as it returns back from the scene at a high temporal
resolution. We propose to model this image formation process, account for its
non-idealities, and adapt neural rendering to reconstruct 3D geometry from a
set of spatially distributed sensors with known poses. We show that our
approach can successfully recover complex 3D shapes from simulated data. We
further demonstrate 3D object reconstruction from real-world captures,
utilizing measurements from a commodity proximity sensor. Our work draws a
connection between image-based modeling and active range scanning and is a step
towards 3D vision with single-photon cameras.

development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini-pro, which have
begun to transform a variety of applications. These sophisticated multimodal
models are designed to interpret and analyze complex data, integrating both
textual and visual information on a scale previously unattainable, opening new
avenues for a range of applications. This paper investigates the applicability
and effectiveness of prompt-engineered Gemini-pro LMMs versus fine-tuned Vision
Transformer (ViT) models in addressing critical security challenges. We focus
on two distinct tasks: a visually evident task of detecting simple triggers,
such as small squares in images, indicative of potential backdoors, and a
non-visually evident task of malware classification through visual
representations. Our results highlight a significant divergence in performance,
with Gemini-pro falling short in accuracy and reliability when compared to
fine-tuned ViT models. The ViT models, on the other hand, demonstrate
exceptional accuracy, achieving near-perfect performance on both tasks. This
study not only showcases the strengths and limitations of prompt-engineered
LMMs in cybersecurity applications but also emphasizes the unmatched efficacy
of fine-tuned ViT models for precise and dependable tasks.

geometries from text descriptions. GenesisTex adapts the pretrained image
diffusion model to texture space by texture space sampling. Specifically, we
maintain a latent texture map for each viewpoint, which is updated with
predicted noise on the rendering of the corresponding viewpoint. The sampled
latent texture maps are then decoded into a final texture map. During the
sampling process, we focus on both global and local consistency across multiple
viewpoints: global consistency is achieved through the integration of style
consistency mechanisms within the noise prediction network, and low-level
consistency is achieved by dynamically aligning latent textures. Finally, we
apply reference-based inpainting and img2img on denser views for texture
refinement. Our approach overcomes the limitations of slow optimization in
distillation-based methods and instability in inpainting-based methods.
Experiments on meshes from various sources demonstrate that our method
surpasses the baseline methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

synthesizing a diversity of realistic abdominal lymph node data. We propose
LN-DDPM, a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for lymph

structure masks as model conditions. These conditions work in two conditioning
mechanisms: global structure conditioning and local detail conditioning, to
distinguish between lymph nodes and their surroundings and better capture lymph
node characteristics. The obtained paired abdominal lymph node images and masks
are used for the downstream segmentation task. Experimental results on the
abdominal lymph node datasets demonstrate that LN-DDPM outperforms other
generative methods in the abdominal lymph node image synthesis and better
assists the downstream abdominal lymph node segmentation task.

multiple tri-plane hash-encodings for efficient scene representation. MUTE-SLAM
effectively tracks camera positions and incrementally builds a scalable
multi-map representation for both small and large indoor environments. It
dynamically allocates sub-maps for newly observed local regions, enabling
constraint-free mapping without prior scene information. Unlike traditional
grid-based methods, we use three orthogonal axis-aligned planes for
hash-encoding scene properties, significantly reducing hash collisions and the
number of trainable parameters. This hybrid approach not only speeds up
convergence but also enhances the fidelity of surface reconstruction.
Furthermore, our optimization strategy concurrently optimizes all sub-maps
intersecting with the current camera frustum, ensuring global consistency.
Extensive testing on both real-world and synthetic datasets has shown that
MUTE-SLAM delivers state-of-the-art surface reconstruction quality and
competitive tracking performance across diverse indoor settings. The code will
be made public upon acceptance of the paper.

                                        <span>  In this work, we introduce two types of makeup prior models to extend
existing 3D face prior models: PCA-based and StyleGAN2-based priors. The
PCA-based prior model is a linear model that is easy to construct and is
computationally efficient. However, it retains only low-frequency information.
Conversely, the StyleGAN2-based model can represent high-frequency information
with relatively higher computational cost than the PCA-based model. Although
there is a trade-off between the two models, both are applicable to 3D facial
makeup estimation and related applications. By leveraging makeup prior models
and designing a makeup consistency module, we effectively address the
challenges that previous methods faced in robustly estimating makeup,
particularly in the context of handling self-occluded faces. In experiments, we
demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs by several orders of
magnitude, achieving speeds up to 180 times faster. In addition, by improving
the accuracy of the estimated makeup, we confirm that our methods are highly
advantageous for various 3D facial makeup applications such as 3D makeup face
reconstruction, user-friendly makeup editing, makeup transfer, and
interpolation.

Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) have allowed for unparalleled mapping of the
surface mineralogy of Mars. Due to sensor degradation over time, a significant
portion of the recently acquired data is considered unusable. Here a new
data-driven model architecture, Noise2Noise4Mars (N2N4M), is introduced to
remove noise from CRISM images. Our model is self-supervised and does not
require zero-noise target data, making it well suited for use in Planetary
Science applications where high quality labelled data is scarce. We demonstrate
its strong performance on synthetic-noise data and CRISM images, and its impact
on downstream classification performance, outperforming benchmark methods on
most metrics. This allows for detailed analysis for critical sites of interest
on the Martian surface, including proposed lander sites.

                                        <span>  In the realm of healthcare, the challenges of copyright protection and
unauthorized third-party misuse are increasingly significant. Traditional
methods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,
implying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper
introduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the
copyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by
"cooking" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models
that perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment
phase, the original test data must be also "cooked" through DataCook to ensure
normal model performance. This process grants copyright holders control over
authorization during the deployment phase. The mechanism behind DataCook is by
crafting anti-adversarial examples (AntiAdv), which are designed to enhance
model confidence, as opposed to standard adversarial examples (Adv) that aim to
confuse models. Similar to Adv, AntiAdv introduces imperceptible perturbations,
ensuring that the data processed by DataCook remains easily understandable. We
conducted extensive experiments on MedMNIST datasets, encompassing both 2D/3D
data and the high-resolution variants. The outcomes indicate that DataCook
effectively meets its objectives, preventing models trained on AntiAdv from
analyzing unauthorized data effectively, without compromising the validity and
accuracy of the data in legitimate scenarios. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/MedMNIST/DataCook.

                                        <span>  Previous multi-task dense prediction methods based on the Mixture of Experts
(MoE) have received great performance but they neglect the importance of
explicitly modeling the global relations among all tasks. In this paper, we
present a novel decoder-focused method for multi-task dense prediction, called
Mixture-of-Low-Rank-Experts (MLoRE). To model the global task relationships,
MLoRE adds a generic convolution path to the original MoE structure, where each
task feature can go through this path for explicit parameter sharing.
Furthermore, to control the parameters and computational cost brought by the
increase in the number of experts, we take inspiration from LoRA and propose to
leverage the low-rank format of a vanilla convolution in the expert network.
Since the low-rank experts have fewer parameters and can be dynamically
parameterized into the generic convolution, the parameters and computational
cost do not change much with the increase of experts. Benefiting from this
design, we increase the number of experts and its reception field to enlarge
the representation capacity, facilitating multiple dense tasks learning in a
unified network. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2
benchmarks show that our MLoRE achieves superior performance compared to
previous state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/YuqiYang213/MLoRE.

repositories. With recent research and improvements in denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPM), high quality synthetic medical scans are now
possible. Despite this, there is currently no way of generating multiple
related images, such as a corresponding ground truth which can be used to train
models, so synthetic scans are often manually annotated before use. This
research introduces a novel architecture that is able to generate multiple,
related PET-CT-tumour mask pairs using paired networks and conditional
encoders. Our approach includes innovative, time step-controlled mechanisms and
a `noise-seeding' strategy to improve DDPM sampling consistency. While our
model requires a modified perceptual loss function to ensure accurate feature
alignment we show generation of clearly aligned synthetic images and
improvement in segmentation accuracy with generated images.

limited time and interest in various topics to improve their learning
efficiency. To this end, video summarization has been actively researched to
enable users to view only important scenes from a video. However, these studies
focus on either the visual or audio information of a video and extract
important segments in the video. Therefore, there is a risk of missing
important information when both the teacher's speech and visual information on
the blackboard or slides are important, such as in a lecture video. To tackle
this issue, we propose FastPerson, a video summarization approach that
considers both the visual and auditory information in lecture videos.
FastPerson creates summary videos by utilizing audio transcriptions along with
on-screen images and text, minimizing the risk of overlooking crucial
information for learners. Further, it provides a feature that allows learners
to switch between the summary and original videos for each chapter of the
video, enabling them to adjust the pace of learning based on their interests
and level of understanding. We conducted an evaluation with 40 participants to
assess the effectiveness of our method and confirmed that it reduced viewing
time by 53\% at the same level of comprehension as that when using traditional
video playback methods.

image processing techniques is a prominent way to make these inspections more
effective, robust, and less expensive. In this paper, we investigate the
development of a novel deep-learning method for the detection of fatigue cracks
in high-resolution images of steel bridges. First, we present a novel and
challenging dataset comprising of images of cracks in steel bridges. Secondly,
we integrate the ConvNext neural network with a previous state- of-the-art
encoder-decoder network for crack segmentation. We study and report, the
effects of the use of background patches on the network performance when
applied to high-resolution images of cracks in steel bridges. Finally, we
introduce a loss function that allows the use of more background patches for
the training process, which yields a significant reduction in false positive
rates.

necessitates effective measures to prevent their leakage during transportation
and storage, given their high toxicity. Thermal infrared-based computer vision
detection techniques provide a straightforward approach to identify gas leakage
areas. However, the development of high-quality algorithms has been challenging
due to the low texture in thermal images and the lack of open-source datasets.
In this paper, we present the RGB-Thermal Cross Attention Network (RT-CAN),
which employs an RGB-assisted two-stream network architecture to integrate
texture information from RGB images and gas area information from thermal
images. Additionally, to facilitate the research of invisible gas detection, we
introduce Gas-DB, an extensive open-source gas detection database including
about 1.3K well-annotated RGB-thermal images with eight variant collection
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully leverages
the advantages of both modalities, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance among RGB-thermal methods, surpassing single-stream SOTA models in
terms of accuracy, Intersection of Union (IoU), and F2 metrics by 4.86%, 5.65%,
and 4.88%, respectively. The code and data will be made available soon.

                                        <span>  Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) has seen significant advancements with
Transformer-based architectures recently. However, we identify two key
limitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based
VRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.
Under the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a
query is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a
query to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also
insufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,
therefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being
assigned no relation as a GT. To address these issues, we propose Groupwise
Query Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise
Query Specialization trains a specialized query by dividing queries and
relations into disjoint groups and directing a query in a specific query group
solely toward relations in the corresponding relation group. Quality-Aware
Multi-Assignment further facilitates the training by assigning a GT to multiple
predictions that are significantly close to a GT in terms of a subject, an
object, and the relation in between. Experimental results and analyses show
that SpeaQ effectively trains specialized queries, which better utilize the
capacity of a model, resulting in consistent performance gains with zero
additional inference cost across multiple VRD models and benchmarks. Code is
available at https://github.com/mlvlab/SpeaQ.

maximizing the quality of immersive panoramic video services that match users'
personal preferences and habits has become a long-standing challenge.
Understanding the saliency region where users focus, based on data collected
with HMDs, can promote multimedia encoding, transmission, and quality
assessment. At the same time, large-scale datasets are essential for
researchers and developers to explore short/long-term user behavior patterns
and train AI models related to panoramic videos. However, existing panoramic
video datasets often include low-frequency user head or eye movement data
through short-term videos only, lacking sufficient data for analyzing users'
Field of View (FoV) and generating video saliency regions.
  Driven by these practical factors, in this paper, we present a head and eye
tracking dataset involving 50 users (25 males and 25 females) watching 15
panoramic videos. The dataset provides details on the viewport and gaze
attention locations of users. Besides, we present some statistics samples
extracted from the dataset. For example, the deviation between head and eye
movements challenges the widely held assumption that gaze attention decreases
from the center of the FoV following a Gaussian distribution. Our analysis
reveals a consistent downward offset in gaze fixations relative to the FoV in
experimental settings involving multiple users and videos. That's why we name
the dataset Panonut, a saliency weighting shaped like a donut. Finally, we also
provide a script that generates saliency distributions based on given head or
eye coordinates and pre-generated saliency distribution map sets of each video
from the collected eye tracking data.
  The dataset is available on website: https://dianvrlab.github.io/Panonut360/.

retrieval. Due to the cross-domain problem of traffic images, we divide the
problem into two sub-tasks of pedestrian retrieval and vehicle retrieval
through a simple strategy. In pedestrian retrieval tasks, we use IRRA as the
base model and specifically design an Attribute Classification to mine the
knowledge implied by attribute labels. More importantly, We use the strategy of
Inclusion Relation Matching to make the image-text pairs with inclusion
relation have similar representation in the feature space. For the vehicle
retrieval task, we use BLIP as the base model. Since aligning the color
attributes of vehicles is challenging, we introduce attribute-based object
detection techniques to add color patch blocks to vehicle images for color data
augmentation. This serves as strong prior information, helping the model
perform the image-text alignment. At the same time, we incorporate labeled
attributes into the image-text alignment loss to learn fine-grained alignment
and prevent similar images and texts from being incorrectly separated. Our
approach ranked first in the final B-board test with a score of 70.9.

(CNNs) and Transformer models have made significant advancements in this realm,
but they still encounter challenges because of limited receptive field or high
computing complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba
and its variants, have demonstrated notable performance in the field of vision.
However, their feature extraction methods may not be sufficiently effective and
retain some redundant structures, leaving room for parameter reduction.
Motivated by previous spatial and channel attention methods, we propose Triplet
Mamba-UNet. The method leverages residual VSS Blocks to extract intensive
contextual features, while Triplet SSM is employed to fuse features across
spatial and channel dimensions. We conducted experiments on ISIC17, ISIC18,
CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvasir-Instrument datasets,
demonstrating the superior segmentation performance of our proposed TM-UNet.
Additionally, compared to the previous VM-UNet, our model achieves a one-third

adjacency of tokens in the scanning sequence, and (ii) direction-aware updating
which enables the model to discern the spatial relations of tokens by encoding
directional information. Our architecture is designed to be easy to use and
easy to scale, formed by stacking identical PlainMamba blocks, resulting in a
model with constant width throughout all layers. The architecture is further
simplified by removing the need for special tokens. We evaluate PlainMamba on a
variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves
performance gains over previous non-hierarchical models and is competitive with
hierarchical alternatives. For tasks requiring high-resolution inputs, in
particular, PlainMamba requires much less computing while maintaining high
performance. Code and models are available at

high-quality animation driven by audio and a reference portrait image. Our
methodology is divided into two stages. Initially, we extract 3D intermediate
representations from audio and project them into a sequence of 2D facial
landmarks. Subsequently, we employ a robust diffusion model, coupled with a
motion module, to convert the landmark sequence into photorealistic and
temporally consistent portrait animation. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of AniPortrait in terms of facial naturalness, pose diversity, and
visual quality, thereby offering an enhanced perceptual experience. Moreover,
our methodology exhibits considerable potential in terms of flexibility and
controllability, which can be effectively applied in areas such as facial
motion editing or face reenactment. We release code and model weights at

for a large class of dynamical systems using diffusion models. The core
objective is to develop stabilizing control functions by identifying the
closest asymptotically stable vector field relative to a predetermined manifold
and adjusting the control function based on this finding. To achieve this, we
employ a diffusion model trained on pairs consisting of asymptotically stable
vector fields and their corresponding Lyapunov functions. Our numerical results
demonstrate that this pre-trained model can achieve stabilization over
previously unseen systems efficiently and rapidly, showcasing the potential of
our approach in fast zero-shot control and generalizability.

                                        <span>  The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, including
GitHub Copilot, OpenAI GPT, and Stable Diffusion, has revolutionized content
creation, enabling non-professionals to produce high-quality content across
various domains. This transformative technology has led to a surge of synthetic
content and sparked legal disputes over copyright infringement. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the
learning capacity of GenAI models for copyright legal analysis, demonstrated
with GPT2 and Stable Diffusion models. Copyright law distinguishes between
original expressions and generic ones (Sc\`enes \`a faire), protecting the
former and permitting reproduction of the latter. However, this distinction has
historically been challenging to make consistently, leading to over-protection
of copyrighted works. GenAI offers an unprecedented opportunity to enhance this
legal analysis by revealing shared patterns in preexisting works. We propose a
data-driven approach to identify the genericity of works created by GenAI,
employing "data-driven bias" to assess the genericity of expressive
compositions. This approach aids in copyright scope determination by utilizing
the capabilities of GenAI to identify and prioritize expressive elements and
rank them according to their frequency in the model's dataset. The potential
implications of measuring expressive genericity for copyright law are profound.
Such scoring could assist courts in determining copyright scope during
litigation, inform the registration practices of Copyright Offices, allowing
registration of only highly original synthetic works, and help copyright owners
signal the value of their works and facilitate fairer licensing deals. More
generally, this approach offers valuable insights to policymakers grappling
with adapting copyright law to the challenges posed by the era of GenAI.

systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles.
These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and,
therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion
forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification
persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal
distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently
training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical
loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by
grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions,
effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens
achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for
improving trajectory forecasting techniques.

challenging task due to their complex, not fully-understood interactions with
external factors, such as geometry and lighting. Supervised deep learning
models have recently been shown to outperform traditional approaches, but rely
on large datasets of human-annotated images for accurate perception
predictions. Obtaining reliable annotations is a costly endeavor, aggravated by
the limited ability of these models to generalise to different aspects of
appearance. In this work, we show how a much smaller set of human annotations
("strong labels") can be effectively augmented with automatically derived "weak
labels" in the context of learning a low-dimensional image-computable gloss
metric. We evaluate three alternative weak labels for predicting human gloss
perception from limited annotated data. Incorporating weak labels enhances our
gloss prediction beyond the current state of the art. Moreover, it enables a
substantial reduction in human annotation costs without sacrificing accuracy,
whether working with rendered images or real photographs.

pose, expression and lighting, of human facial images while preserving
attributes like identity and background, showing great importance in
photograph. In spite of the great progress in this area, current researches
generally meet three challenges: low generation fidelity, poor attribute
preservation, and inefficient inference. To overcome above challenges, this
paper presents DiffFAE, a one-stage and highly-efficient diffusion-based
framework tailored for high-fidelity FAE. For high-fidelity query attributes
transfer, we adopt Space-sensitive Physical Customization (SPC), which ensures
the fidelity and generalization ability by utilizing rendering texture derived
from 3D Morphable Model (3DMM). In order to preserve source attributes, we
introduce the Region-responsive Semantic Composition (RSC). This module is
guided to learn decoupled source-regarding features, thereby better preserving
the identity and alleviating artifacts from non-facial attributes such as hair,
clothes, and background. We further introduce a consistency regularization for
our pipeline to enhance editing controllability by leveraging prior knowledge
in the attention matrices of diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of DiffFAE over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in facial appearance editing.

                                        <span>  The speed-precision trade-off is a critical problem for visual object
tracking which usually requires low latency and deployment on constrained
resources. Existing solutions for efficient tracking mainly focus on adopting
light-weight backbones or modules, which nevertheless come at the cost of a
sacrifice in precision. In this paper, inspired by dynamic network routing, we
propose DyTrack, a dynamic transformer framework for efficient tracking.
Real-world tracking scenarios exhibit diverse levels of complexity. We argue
that a simple network is sufficient for easy frames in video sequences, while
more computation could be assigned to difficult ones. DyTrack automatically
learns to configure proper reasoning routes for various inputs, gaining better
utilization of the available computational budget. Thus, it can achieve higher
performance with the same running speed. We formulate instance-specific
tracking as a sequential decision problem and attach terminating branches to
intermediate layers of the entire model. Especially, to fully utilize the
computations, we introduce the feature recycling mechanism to reuse the outputs
of predecessors. Furthermore, a target-aware self-distillation strategy is
designed to enhance the discriminating capabilities of early predictions by
effectively mimicking the representation pattern of the deep model. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DyTrack achieves promising
speed-precision trade-offs with only a single model. For instance, DyTrack
obtains 64.9% AUC on LaSOT with a speed of 256 fps.

from one domain to another while maintaining the essential content
representations. In recent years, image-to-image translation has gained
significant attention and achieved remarkable advancements due to its diverse
applications in computer vision and image processing tasks. In this work, we
propose an innovative method for image translation between different domains.
For high-resolution image translation tasks, we use a grayscale adjustment
method to achieve pixel-level translation. For other tasks, we utilize the
Pix2PixHD model with a coarse-to-fine generator, multi-scale discriminator, and
improved loss to enhance the image translation performance. On the other hand,
to tackle the issue of sparse training data, we adopt model weight
initialization from other task to optimize the performance of the current task.

                                        <span>  We propose a voxel-based optimization framework, ReVoRF, for few-shot
radiance fields that strategically address the unreliability in pseudo novel
view synthesis. Our method pivots on the insight that relative depth
relationships within neighboring regions are more reliable than the absolute
color values in disoccluded areas. Consequently, we devise a bilateral
geometric consistency loss that carefully navigates the trade-off between color
fidelity and geometric accuracy in the context of depth consistency for
uncertain regions. Moreover, we present a reliability-guided learning strategy
to discern and utilize the variable quality across synthesized views,
complemented by a reliability-aware voxel smoothing algorithm that smoothens
the transition between reliable and unreliable data patches. Our approach
allows for a more nuanced use of all available data, promoting enhanced
learning from regions previously considered unsuitable for high-quality
reconstruction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets reveal that our
approach attains significant gains in efficiency and accuracy, delivering
rendering speeds of 3 FPS, 7 mins to train a $360^\circ$ scene, and a 5\%
improvement in PSNR over existing few-shot methods. Code is available at

concentrated on adapting between established, high-density autonomous driving

both self-driving car and mobile robot domains. Our code is open-source and

from a single image, with controllable facial expressions, head poses, and
shoulder movements. Unlike previous reenactment methods, our approach utilizes
a view-conditioned 2D diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images from a
single art portrait with a neutral expression. With the generated colors and
normals, we synthesize a static avatar using an SDF-based neural surface. For
avatar animation, we extract control points, transfer the motion with these
points, and deform the implicit canonical space. Firstly, we render the front
image of the avatar, extract the 2D landmarks, and project them to the 3D space
using a trained SDF network. We extract 3D driving landmarks using 3DMM and
transfer the motion to the avatar landmarks. To animate the avatar pose, we
manually set the body height and bound the head and torso of an avatar with two
cages. The head and torso can be animated by transforming the two cages. Our
approach is a one-shot pipeline that can be applied to various styles.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality 3D art
avatars with desired control over different motions.

image-based drug discovery to extract feature vectors from single cells in
microscopy images. To better understand how these networks perform
representation learning, we employ visual explainability techniques (e.g.,
Grad-CAM). Our analyses reveal several mechanisms by which supervised models
cheat, exploiting biologically irrelevant pixels when extracting morphological
features from images, such as noise in the background. This raises doubts
regarding the fidelity of learned single-cell representations and their

misalignment between researcher expectations and machine behavior, we introduce
Grad-CAMO, a novel single-cell interpretability score for supervised feature
extractors. Grad-CAMO measures the proportion of a model's attention that is
concentrated on the cell of interest versus the background. This metric can be
assessed per-cell or averaged across a validation set, offering a tool to audit
individual features vectors or guide the improved design of deep learning
architectures. Importantly, Grad-CAMO seamlessly integrates into existing

both 2D and 3D Cell Painting data. Additional results are available at

for motion understanding and physically plausible motion generation. However,
most of the foot-contact annotations in existing datasets are estimated by
purely visual matching and distance thresholding, which results in low accuracy
and coarse granularity. Even though existing multimodal datasets
synergistically capture plantar pressure (foot contact) and visual signals,
they are specifically designed for small-range and slow motion such as Taiji
Quan and Yoga. Therefore, there is still a lack of a vision-pressure multimodal
dataset with large-range and fast human motion, as well as accurate and dense
foot-contact annotation. To fill this gap, we propose a Multimodal MoCap
Dataset with Vision and Pressure sensors, named MMVP. MMVP provides accurate
and dense plantar pressure signals synchronized with RGBD observations, which
is especially useful for both plausible shape estimation, robust pose fitting
without foot drifting, and accurate global translation tracking. To validate
the dataset, we propose an RGBD-P SMPL fitting method and also a
monocular-video-based baseline framework, VP-MoCap, for human motion capture.
Experiments demonstrate that our RGBD-P SMPL Fitting results significantly
outperform pure visual motion capture. Moreover, VP-MoCap outperforms SOTA
methods in foot-contact and global translation estimation accuracy. We believe
the configuration of the dataset and the baseline frameworks will stimulate the
research in this direction and also provide a good reference for MoCap
applications in various domains. Project page:

                                        <span>  The widespread adoption of generative image models has highlighted the urgent
need to detect artificial content, which is a crucial step in combating
widespread manipulation and misinformation. Consequently, numerous detectors
and associated datasets have emerged. However, many of these datasets
inadvertently introduce undesirable biases, thereby impacting the effectiveness
and evaluation of detectors. In this paper, we emphasize that many datasets for
AI-generated image detection contain biases related to JPEG compression and
image size. Using the GenImage dataset, we demonstrate that detectors indeed
learn from these undesired factors. Furthermore, we show that removing the
named biases substantially increases robustness to JPEG compression and
significantly alters the cross-generator performance of evaluated detectors.
Specifically, it leads to more than 11 percentage points increase in
cross-generator performance for ResNet50 and Swin-T detectors on the GenImage
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.

                                        <span>  With the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, how to
adapt them to various downstream classification tasks has garnered significant
attention in recent research. The adaptation strategies can be typically
categorized into three paradigms: zero-shot adaptation, few-shot adaptation,
and the recently-proposed training-free few-shot adaptation. Most existing
approaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two
of these paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a versatile adaptation approach
that can effectively work under all three settings. Specifically, we propose
the dual memory networks that comprise dynamic and static memory components.
The static memory caches training data knowledge, enabling training-free
few-shot adaptation, while the dynamic memory preserves historical test
features online during the testing process, allowing for the exploration of
additional data insights beyond the training set. This novel capability
enhances model performance in the few-shot setting and enables model usability
in the absence of training data. The two memory networks employ the same
flexible memory interactive strategy, which can operate in a training-free mode
and can be further enhanced by incorporating learnable projection layers. Our
approach is tested across 11 datasets under the three task settings.
Remarkably, in the zero-shot scenario, it outperforms existing methods by over
3\% and even shows superior results against methods utilizing external training
data. Additionally, our method exhibits robust performance against natural
distribution shifts. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/DMN}.

                                        <span>  Recently, significant progress has been achieved in sensing real large-scale
outdoor 3D environments, particularly by using modern acquisition equipment
such as LiDAR sensors. Unfortunately, they are fundamentally limited in their
ability to produce dense, complete 3D scenes. To address this issue, recent
learning-based methods integrate neural implicit representations and
optimizable feature grids to approximate surfaces of 3D scenes. However,
naively fitting samples along raw LiDAR rays leads to noisy 3D mapping results
due to the nature of sparse, conflicting LiDAR measurements. Instead, in this
work we depart from fitting LiDAR data exactly, instead letting the network
optimize a non-metric monotonic implicit field defined in 3D space. To fit our
field, we design a learning system integrating a monotonicity loss that enables
optimizing neural monotonic fields and leverages recent progress in large-scale
3D mapping. Our algorithm achieves high-quality dense 3D mapping performance as
captured by multiple quantitative and perceptual measures and visual results
obtained for Mai City, Newer College, and KITTI benchmarks. The code of our
approach will be made publicly available.

                                        <span>  The medical field is one of the important fields in the application of
artificial intelligence technology. With the explosive growth and
diversification of medical data, as well as the continuous improvement of
medical needs and challenges, artificial intelligence technology is playing an
increasingly important role in the medical field. Artificial intelligence
technologies represented by computer vision, natural language processing, and
machine learning have been widely penetrated into diverse scenarios such as
medical imaging, health management, medical information, and drug research and
development, and have become an important driving force for improving the level
and quality of medical services.The article explores the transformative
potential of generative AI in medical imaging, emphasizing its ability to
generate syntheticACM-2 data, enhance images, aid in anomaly detection, and
facilitate image-to-image translation. Despite challenges like model
complexity, the applications of generative models in healthcare, including
Med-PaLM 2 technology, show promising results. By addressing limitations in
dataset size and diversity, these models contribute to more accurate diagnoses
and improved patient outcomes. However, ethical considerations and
collaboration among stakeholders are essential for responsible implementation.
Through experiments leveraging GANs to augment brain tumor MRI datasets, the
study demonstrates how generative AI can enhance image quality and diversity,
ultimately advancing medical diagnostics and patient care.

answering (VQA), often contain ambiguities caused by reliance on directive
information. This problem is exacerbated because some languages, such as
Japanese, often omit subjective or objective terms. Such ambiguities in
questions are often clarified by the contexts in conversational situations,
such as joint attention with a user or user gaze information. In this study, we
propose the Gaze-grounded VQA dataset (GazeVQA) that clarifies ambiguous
questions using gaze information by focusing on a clarification process
complemented by gaze information. We also propose a method that utilizes gaze
target estimation results to improve the accuracy of GazeVQA tasks. Our
experimental results showed that the proposed method improved the performance
in some cases of a VQA system on GazeVQA and identified some typical problems
of GazeVQA tasks that need to be improved.

generation of 3D garments with high-quality textures. We propose "WordRobe", a
novel framework for the generation of unposed & textured 3D garment meshes from
user-friendly text prompts. We achieve this by first learning a latent
representation of 3D garments using a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
and a loss for latent disentanglement, promoting better latent interpolation.
Subsequently, we align the garment latent space to the CLIP embedding space in
a weakly supervised manner, enabling text-driven 3D garment generation and
editing. For appearance modeling, we leverage the zero-shot generation
capability of ControlNet to synthesize view-consistent texture maps in a single
feed-forward inference step, thereby drastically decreasing the generation time
as compared to existing methods. We demonstrate superior performance over
current SOTAs for learning 3D garment latent space, garment interpolation, and
text-driven texture synthesis, supported by quantitative evaluation and
qualitative user study. The unposed 3D garment meshes generated using WordRobe
can be directly fed to standard cloth simulation & animation pipelines without
any post-processing.

                                        <span>  Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has been widely recognized for its excellence in
novel view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, their effectiveness
is inherently tied to the assumption of static scenes, rendering them
susceptible to undesirable artifacts when confronted with transient distractors
such as moving objects or shadows. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm,
namely "Heuristics-Guided Segmentation" (HuGS), which significantly enhances
the separation of static scenes from transient distractors by harmoniously
combining the strengths of hand-crafted heuristics and state-of-the-art
segmentation models, thus significantly transcending the limitations of
previous solutions. Furthermore, we delve into the meticulous design of
heuristics, introducing a seamless fusion of Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based
heuristics and color residual heuristics, catering to a diverse range of
texture profiles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and
robustness of our method in mitigating transient distractors for NeRFs trained
in non-static scenes. Project page: https://cnhaox.github.io/NeRF-HuGS/.

                                        <span>  Background and objective: Employing deep learning models in critical domains
such as medical imaging poses challenges associated with the limited
availability of training data. We present a strategy for improving the
performance and generalization capabilities of models trained in low-data
regimes. Methods: The proposed method starts with a pre-training phase, where
features learned in a self-supervised learning setting are disentangled to
improve the robustness of the representations for downstream tasks. We then
introduce a meta-fine-tuning step, leveraging related classes between
meta-training and meta-testing phases but varying the granularity level. This
approach aims to enhance the model's generalization capabilities by exposing it
to more challenging classification tasks during meta-training and evaluating it
on easier tasks but holding greater clinical relevance during meta-testing. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a series of
experiments exploring several backbones, as well as diverse pre-training and
fine-tuning schemes, on two distinct medical tasks, i.e., classification of
prostate cancer aggressiveness from MRI data and classification of breast
cancer malignity from microscopic images. Results: Our results indicate that
the proposed approach consistently yields superior performance w.r.t. ablation
experiments, maintaining competitiveness even when a distribution shift between
training and evaluation data occurs. Conclusion: Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of the proposed approach.
We hope that this work will add another solution to the arsenal of addressing
learning issues in data-scarce imaging domains.

human being. For graphic sketch representation learning, recent studies have
injected sketch drawing orders into graph edge construction by linking each
patch to another in accordance to a temporal-based nearest neighboring
strategy. However, such constructed graph edges may be unreliable, since a
sketch could have variants of drawings. In this paper, we propose a
variant-drawing-protected method by equipping sketch patches with context-aware
positional encoding (PE) to make better use of drawing orders for learning
graphic sketch representation. Instead of injecting sketch drawings into graph
edges, we embed these sequential information into graph nodes only. More
specifically, each patch embedding is equipped with a sinusoidal absolute PE to
highlight the sequential position in the drawing order. And its neighboring
patches, ranked by the values of self-attention scores between patch
embeddings, are equipped with learnable relative PEs to restore the contextual
positions within a neighborhood. During message aggregation via graph
convolutional networks, a node receives both semantic contents from patch
embeddings and contextual patterns from PEs by its neighbors, arriving at
drawing-order-enhanced sketch representations. Experimental results indicate
that our method significantly improves sketch healing and controllable sketch
synthesis.

                                        <span>  Adversarial training is extensively utilized to improve the adversarial
robustness of deep neural networks. Yet, mitigating the degradation of standard
generalization performance in adversarial-trained models remains an open
problem. This paper attempts to resolve this issue through the lens of model
complexity. First, We leverage the Fisher-Rao norm, a geometrically invariant
metric for model complexity, to establish the non-trivial bounds of the
Cross-Entropy Loss-based Rademacher complexity for a ReLU-activated Multi-Layer
Perceptron. Then we generalize a complexity-related variable, which is
sensitive to the changes in model width and the trade-off factors in
adversarial training. Moreover, intensive empirical evidence validates that
this variable highly correlates with the generalization gap of Cross-Entropy
loss between adversarial-trained and standard-trained models, especially during
the initial and final phases of the training process. Building upon this
observation, we propose a novel regularization framework, called Logit-Oriented
Adversarial Training (LOAT), which can mitigate the trade-off between
robustness and accuracy while imposing only a negligible increase in
computational overhead. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
regularization strategy can boost the performance of the prevalent adversarial
training algorithms, including PGD-AT, TRADES, TRADES (LSE), MART, and DM-AT,
across various network architectures. Our code will be available at

biological neural systems have become popular research directions in recent
years. Pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) is a well applicated model for
imitating the computation characteristics of the human brain in computer vision
and neural network fields. However, differences between the PCNN and biological
neural systems remain: limited neural connection, high computational cost, and
lack of stochastic property. In this study, random-coupled neural network
(RCNN) is proposed. It overcomes these difficulties in PCNN's neuromorphic
computing via a random inactivation process. This process randomly closes some
neural connections in the RCNN model, realized by the random inactivation
weight matrix of link input. This releases the computational burden of PCNN,
making it affordable to achieve vast neural connections. Furthermore, the image
and video processing mechanisms of RCNN are researched. It encodes constant
stimuli as periodic spike trains and periodic stimuli as chaotic spike trains,
the same as biological neural information encoding characteristics. Finally,
the RCNN is applicated to image segmentation, fusion, and pulse shape
discrimination subtasks. It is demonstrated to be robust, efficient, and highly
anti-noised, with outstanding performance in all applications mentioned above.

presented a significant challenge. Existing methods adhering to this constraint
are prone to catastrophic forgetting, far more so than replay-based techniques
that retain access to past samples. In this paper, to solve the exemplar-free
CIL problem, we propose a Dual-Stream Analytic Learning (DS-AL) approach. The
DS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear
solution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting
limitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL
problem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an
equivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The
compensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.
This module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function
from the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the
embedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping. Empirical
results demonstrate that the DS-AL, despite being an exemplar-free technique,
delivers performance comparable with or better than that of replay-based
methods across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and
ImageNet-Full. Additionally, the C-RLS' equivalent property allows the DS-AL to
execute CIL in a phase-invariant manner. This is evidenced by a
never-before-seen 500-phase CIL ImageNet task, which performs on a level
identical to a 5-phase one. Our codes are available at

                                        <span>  The data bottleneck has emerged as a fundamental challenge in learning based
image restoration methods. Researchers have attempted to generate synthesized
training data using paired or unpaired samples to address this challenge. This
study proposes SeNM-VAE, a semi-supervised noise modeling method that leverages
both paired and unpaired datasets to generate realistic degraded data. Our
approach is based on modeling the conditional distribution of degraded and
clean images with a specially designed graphical model. Under the variational
inference framework, we develop an objective function for handling both paired
and unpaired data. We employ our method to generate paired training samples for
real-world image denoising and super-resolution tasks. Our approach excels in
the quality of synthetic degraded images compared to other unpaired and paired
noise modeling methods. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates remarkable
performance in downstream image restoration tasks, even with limited paired
data. With more paired data, our method achieves the best performance on the
SIDD dataset.

interested in achieving a successful outcome, but do also implicitly negotiate
the effort they put into the interaction (by adapting to each other). In this
work, we propose a challenging interactive reference game that requires two
players to coordinate on vision and language observations. The learning signal
in this game is a score (given after playing) that takes into account the
achieved goal and the players' assumed efforts during the interaction. We show
that a standard Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) setup achieves a high
success rate when bootstrapped with heuristic partner behaviors that implement
insights from the analysis of human-human interactions. And we find that a
pairing of neural partners indeed reduces the measured joint effort when
playing together repeatedly. However, we observe that in comparison to a
reasonable heuristic pairing there is still room for improvement -- which
invites further research in the direction of cost-sharing in collaborative
interactions.

                                        <span>  In the film and gaming industries, achieving a realistic hair appearance
typically involves the use of strands originating from the scalp. However,
reconstructing these strands from observed surface images of hair presents
significant challenges. The difficulty in acquiring Ground Truth (GT) data has
led state-of-the-art learning-based methods to rely on pre-training with
manually prepared synthetic CG data. This process is not only labor-intensive
and costly but also introduces complications due to the domain gap when
compared to real-world data. In this study, we propose an optimization-based
approach that eliminates the need for pre-training. Our method represents hair
strands as line segments growing from the scalp and optimizes them using a
novel differentiable rendering algorithm. To robustly optimize a substantial
number of slender explicit geometries, we introduce 3D orientation estimation
utilizing global optimization, strand initialization based on Laplace's
equation, and reparameterization that leverages geometric connectivity and
spatial proximity. Unlike existing optimization-based methods, our method is
capable of reconstructing internal hair flow in an absolute direction. Our
method exhibits robust and accurate inverse rendering, surpassing the quality
of existing methods and significantly improving processing speed.

continuous human gaze sequences on 360{\deg} images based on a conditional
score-based denoising diffusion model. Generating human gaze on 360{\deg}
images is important for various human-computer interaction and computer
graphics applications, e.g. for creating large-scale eye tracking datasets or
for realistic animation of virtual humans. However, existing methods are
limited to predicting discrete fixation sequences or aggregated saliency maps,
thereby neglecting crucial parts of natural gaze behaviour. Our method uses
features extracted from 360{\deg} images as condition and uses two transformers
to model the temporal and spatial dependencies of continuous human gaze. We
evaluate DiffGaze on two 360{\deg} image benchmarks for gaze sequence
generation as well as scanpath prediction and saliency prediction. Our
evaluations show that DiffGaze outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all
tasks on both benchmarks. We also report a 21-participant user study showing
that our method generates gaze sequences that are indistinguishable from real
human sequences.

quality, making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between real and
generated images. This development, while impressive, also raises significant
privacy and security concerns. In response to this, we propose a novel Latent
REconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting
the diffusion-generated images. We come up with the Latent Reconstruction Error
(LaRE), the first reconstruction-error based feature in the latent space for
generated image detection. LaRE surpasses existing methods in terms of feature
extraction efficiency while preserving crucial cues required to differentiate
between the real and the fake. To exploit LaRE, we propose an Error-Guided
feature REfinement module (EGRE), which can refine the image feature guided by
LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an
align-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for
generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority
of our LaRE^2, which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1%
average ACC/AP across 8 different image generators. LaRE also surpasses
existing methods in terms of feature extraction cost, delivering an impressive
speed enhancement of 8 times.

across spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing images. However,
existing RefSR methods are limited by the faithfulness of content
reconstruction and the effectiveness of texture transfer in large scaling
factors. Conditional diffusion models have opened up new opportunities for
generating realistic high-resolution images, but effectively utilizing
reference images within these models remains an area for further exploration.
Furthermore, content fidelity is difficult to guarantee in areas without
relevant reference information. To solve these issues, we propose a
change-aware diffusion model named Ref-Diff for RefSR, using the land cover
change priors to guide the denoising process explicitly. Specifically, we
inject the priors into the denoising model to improve the utilization of
reference information in unchanged areas and regulate the reconstruction of
semantically relevant content in changed areas. With this powerful guidance, we
decouple the semantics-guided denoising and reference texture-guided denoising
processes to improve the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art RefSR methods in both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. The code and data are available at

                                        <span>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant popularity,
but their computational and memory intensity poses challenges for
resource-constrained computing systems, particularly with the prerequisite of
real-time performance. To release this burden, model compression has become an
important research focus. Many approaches like quantization, pruning, early
exit, and knowledge distillation have demonstrated the effect of reducing
redundancy in neural networks. Upon closer examination, it becomes apparent
that each approach capitalizes on its unique features to compress the neural
network, and they can also exhibit complementary behavior when combined. To
explore the interactions and reap the benefits from the complementary features,
we propose the Chain of Compression, which works on the combinational sequence
to apply these common techniques to compress the neural network. Validated on
the image-based regression and classification networks across different data
sets, our proposed Chain of Compression can significantly compress the
computation cost by 100-1000 times with ignorable accuracy loss compared with
the baseline model.

models in medical image segmentation presents a compelling approach to enhance
accuracy and efficiency. We introduce Mamba HUNet, a novel architecture
tailored for robust and efficient segmentation tasks. Leveraging strengths from
Mamba UNet and the lighter version of Hierarchical Upsampling Network (HUNet),
Mamba HUNet combines convolutional neural networks local feature extraction
power with state space models long range dependency modeling capabilities. We
first converted HUNet into a lighter version, maintaining performance parity
and then integrated this lighter HUNet into Mamba HUNet, further enhancing its
efficiency. The architecture partitions input grayscale images into patches,
transforming them into 1D sequences for processing efficiency akin to Vision
Transformers and Mamba models. Through Visual State Space blocks and patch
merging layers, hierarchical features are extracted while preserving spatial
information. Experimental results on publicly available Magnetic Resonance
Imaging scans, notably in Multiple Sclerosis lesion segmentation, demonstrate
Mamba HUNet's effectiveness across diverse segmentation tasks. The model's
robustness and flexibility underscore its potential in handling complex
anatomical structures. These findings establish Mamba HUNet as a promising
solution in advancing medical image segmentation, with implications for
improving clinical decision making processes.

                                        <span>  Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a variety of
computer vision applications. However, there is a problem of degrading accuracy
when the data distribution shifts between training and testing. As a solution
of this problem, Test-time Adaptation~(TTA) has been well studied because of
its practicality. Although TTA methods increase accuracy under distribution
shift by updating the model at test time, using high-uncertainty predictions is
known to degrade accuracy. Since the input image is the root of the
distribution shift, we incorporate a new perspective on enhancing the input
image into TTA methods to reduce the prediction's uncertainty. We hypothesize
that enhancing the input image reduces prediction's uncertainty and increase
the accuracy of TTA methods. On the basis of our hypothesis, we propose a novel
method: Test-time Enhancer and Classifier Adaptation~(TECA). In TECA, the
classification model is combined with the image enhancement model that
transforms input images into recognition-friendly ones, and these models are
updated by existing TTA methods. Furthermore, we found that the prediction from
the enhanced image does not always have lower uncertainty than the prediction
from the original image. Thus, we propose logit switching, which compares the
uncertainty measure of these predictions and outputs the lower one. In our
experiments, we evaluate TECA with various TTA methods and show that TECA
reduces prediction's uncertainty and increases accuracy of TTA methods despite
having no hyperparameters and little parameter overhead.

                                        <span>  We present InterHandGen, a novel framework that learns the generative prior
of two-hand interaction. Sampling from our model yields plausible and diverse
two-hand shapes in close interaction with or without an object. Our prior can
be incorporated into any optimization or learning methods to reduce ambiguity
in an ill-posed setup. Our key observation is that directly modeling the joint
distribution of multiple instances imposes high learning complexity due to its
combinatorial nature. Thus, we propose to decompose the modeling of joint
distribution into the modeling of factored unconditional and conditional single
instance distribution. In particular, we introduce a diffusion model that
learns the single-hand distribution unconditional and conditional to another
hand via conditioning dropout. For sampling, we combine anti-penetration and
classifier-free guidance to enable plausible generation. Furthermore, we
establish the rigorous evaluation protocol of two-hand synthesis, where our
method significantly outperforms baseline generative models in terms of
plausibility and diversity. We also demonstrate that our diffusion prior can
boost the performance of two-hand reconstruction from monocular in-the-wild
images, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy.

                                        <span>  The goal of the multi-sound source localization task is to localize sound
sources from the mixture individually. While recent multi-sound source
localization methods have shown improved performance, they face challenges due
to their reliance on prior information about the number of objects to be
separated. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present a novel
multi-sound source localization method that can perform localization without
prior knowledge of the number of sound sources. To achieve this goal, we
propose an iterative object identification (IOI) module, which can recognize
sound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of
sound-making objects, we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss
to guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but
also distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our
method to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any
prior knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the MUSIC and VGGSound
benchmarks show the significant performance improvements of the proposed method
over the existing methods for both single and multi-source. Our code is

                                        <span>  We investigate a fundamental aspect of machine vision: the measurement of
features, by revisiting clustering, one of the most classic approaches in
machine learning and data analysis. Existing visual feature extractors,
including ConvNets, ViTs, and MLPs, represent an image as rectangular regions.
Though prevalent, such a grid-style paradigm is built upon engineering practice
and lacks explicit modeling of data distribution. In this work, we propose
feature extraction with clustering (FEC), a conceptually elegant yet
surprisingly ad-hoc interpretable neural clustering framework, which views
feature extraction as a process of selecting representatives from data and thus
automatically captures the underlying data distribution. Given an image, FEC
alternates between grouping pixels into individual clusters to abstract
representatives and updating the deep features of pixels with current
representatives. Such an iterative working mechanism is implemented in the form
of several neural layers and the final representatives can be used for
downstream tasks. The cluster assignments across layers, which can be viewed
and inspected by humans, make the forward process of FEC fully transparent and
empower it with promising ad-hoc interpretability. Extensive experiments on
various visual recognition models and tasks verify the effectiveness,
generality, and interpretability of FEC. We expect this work will provoke a
rethink of the current de facto grid-style paradigm.

which designed specifically for point cloud data. Leveraging the
characteristics of non-coincidence and weak correlation of target objects in
point cloud, we adopt a strategy of retaining only the truth-determining pseudo
labels and trimming the other fuzzy labels with points, instead of pursuing a
balance between the quantity and quality of pseudo labels. Besides, we notice
that changing the filter will make the model meet different distributed
targets, which is beneficial to break the training bottleneck. Two mechanism
are introduced to achieve above ideas: strict threshold and filter switching.
The experiments are conducted to analyze the effectiveness of above approaches
and their impact on the overall performance of the system. Evaluating on the
KITTI dataset, SSF3D exhibits superior performance compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released here.

detection (SSM3OD) and discover two primary issues: a misalignment between the
prediction quality of 3D and 2D attributes and the tendency of depth
supervision derived from pseudo-labels to be noisy, leading to significant
optimization conflicts with other reliable forms of supervision. We introduce a
novel decoupled pseudo-labeling (DPL) approach for SSM3OD. Our approach
features a Decoupled Pseudo-label Generation (DPG) module, designed to
efficiently generate pseudo-labels by separately processing 2D and 3D
attributes. This module incorporates a unique homography-based method for
identifying dependable pseudo-labels in BEV space, specifically for 3D
attributes. Additionally, we present a DepthGradient Projection (DGP) module to
mitigate optimization conflicts caused by noisy depth supervision of
pseudo-labels, effectively decoupling the depth gradient and removing
conflicting gradients. This dual decoupling strategy-at both the pseudo-label
generation and gradient levels-significantly improves the utilization of
pseudo-labels in SSM3OD. Our comprehensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark
demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.

                                        <span>  Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion models are capable of
generating high-quality samples, but their quality heavily depends on sampling
guidance techniques, such as classifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free
guidance (CFG). These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional
generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this
paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention
Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both
unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring
additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to
progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising
process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by
substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity
matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture
structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these
degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves
sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG
significantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks
where existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including
ControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and
deblurring.

Driving in recent years. Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation (VIC) becomes one
of the important research area. Due to the complexity of traffic conditions
such as blind spots and occlusion, it greatly limits the perception
capabilities of single-view roadside sensing systems. To further enhance the
accuracy of roadside perception and provide better information to the vehicle
side, in this paper, we constructed holographic intersections with various
layouts to build a large-scale multi-sensor holographic vehicle-infrastructure
cooperation dataset, called HoloVIC. Our dataset includes 3 different types of
sensors (Camera, Lidar, Fisheye) and employs 4 sensor-layouts based on the
different intersections. Each intersection is equipped with 6-18 sensors to
capture synchronous data. While autonomous vehicles pass through these
intersections for collecting VIC data. HoloVIC contains in total on 100k+
synchronous frames from different sensors. Additionally, we annotated 3D
bounding boxes based on Camera, Fisheye, and Lidar. We also associate the IDs
of the same objects across different devices and consecutive frames in
sequence. Based on HoloVIC, we formulated four tasks to facilitate the
development of related research. We also provide benchmarks for these tasks.

novel view synthesis, offering a compelling blend of rendering quality and
computational efficiency. However, also latest approaches in this domain are
not without their shortcomings. 3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl and Kopanas et al.
2023] struggles when tasked with rendering highly detailed scenes, due to
blurring and cloudy artifacts. On the other hand, ADOP [R\"uckert et al. 2022]
can accommodate crisper images, but the neural reconstruction network decreases
performance, it grapples with temporal instability and it is unable to
effectively address large gaps in the point cloud.
  In this paper, we present TRIPS (Trilinear Point Splatting), an approach that
combines ideas from both Gaussian Splatting and ADOP. The fundamental concept
behind our novel technique involves rasterizing points into a screen-space
image pyramid, with the selection of the pyramid layer determined by the
projected point size. This approach allows rendering arbitrarily large points
using a single trilinear write. A lightweight neural network is then used to
reconstruct a hole-free image including detail beyond splat resolution.
Importantly, our render pipeline is entirely differentiable, allowing for
automatic optimization of both point sizes and positions.
  Our evaluation demonstrate that TRIPS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of rendering quality while maintaining a real-time frame rate
of 60 frames per second on readily available hardware. This performance extends
to challenging scenarios, such as scenes featuring intricate geometry,
expansive landscapes, and auto-exposed footage.

unsupervised pathway, two \textit{self-supervised losses} were proposed to
simulate the crowd variations such as scale, illumination, based on which
supervised information pseudo labels were generated and gradually refined. We
also proposed a crowd-driven recurrent unit \textit{Gated-Crowd-Recurrent-Unit
(GCRU)}, which can preserve discriminant crowd information by extracting
second-order statistics, yielding pseudo labels with improved quality. A joint
loss including both unsupervised/supervised information was proposed, and a
dynamic weighting strategy was employed to balance the importance of the
unsupervised loss and supervised loss at different training stages. We
conducted extensive experiments on four popular crowd counting datasets in
semi-supervised settings. Experimental results supported the effectiveness of
each proposed component in our $S^{4}$Crowd framework. Our method achieved
competitive performance in semi-supervised learning approaches on these crowd
counting datasets.

preparation. Understanding such videos is challenging, involving the precise
localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually
annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of
current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy
video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance, but demands
significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain
irrelevant content and exhibit style variation compared to instructions written
by human annotators. To mitigate both issues, we propose a technique,
Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically curate a smaller dataset: (i) Sieve filters
irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap enhances the quality of the text
instruction by automatically replacing the transcripts with human-written
instructions from a text-only recipe dataset. The curated dataset, three orders
of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets, enables efficient
training of large-scale models with competitive performance. We complement our
Sieve-\&-Swap approach with a Procedure Transformer (ProcX) for end-to-end step
localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When this model
is pre-trained on our curated dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art performance
in zero-shot and finetuning settings on YouCook2 and Tasty, while using a
fraction of the computational resources.

                                        <span>  Echocardiography has become an indispensable clinical imaging modality for
general heart health assessment. From calculating biomarkers such as ejection
fraction to the probability of a patient's heart failure, accurate segmentation
of the heart structures allows doctors to assess the heart's condition and
devise treatments with greater precision and accuracy. However, achieving
accurate and reliable left ventricle segmentation is time-consuming and
challenging due to different reasons. Hence, clinicians often rely on
segmenting the left ventricular (LV) in two specific echocardiogram frames to
make a diagnosis. This limited coverage in manual LV segmentation poses a
challenge for developing automatic LV segmentation with high temporal
consistency, as the resulting dataset is typically annotated sparsely. In
response to this challenge, this work introduces SimLVSeg, a novel paradigm
that enables video-based networks for consistent LV segmentation from sparsely
annotated echocardiogram videos. SimLVSeg consists of self-supervised
pre-training with temporal masking, followed by weakly supervised learning
tailored for LV segmentation from sparse annotations. We demonstrate how
SimLVSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by achieving a 93.32%
(95%CI 93.21-93.43%) dice score on the largest 2D+time echocardiography dataset
(EchoNet-Dynamic) while being more efficient. SimLVSeg is compatible with two
types of video segmentation networks: 2D super image and 3D segmentation. To
show the effectiveness of our approach, we provide extensive ablation studies,
including pre-training settings and various deep learning backbones. We further
conduct an out-of-distribution test to showcase SimLVSeg's generalizability on
unseen distribution (CAMUS dataset). The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/fadamsyah/SimLVSeg.

                                        <span>  Vectorized High-Definition (HD) map construction requires predictions of the
category and point coordinates of map elements (e.g. road boundary, lane
divider, pedestrian crossing, etc.). State-of-the-art methods are mainly based
on point-level representation learning for regressing accurate point
coordinates. However, this pipeline has limitations in obtaining element-level
information and handling element-level failures, e.g. erroneous element shape
or entanglement between elements. To tackle the above issues, we propose a
simple yet effective HybrId framework named HIMap to sufficiently learn and
interact both point-level and element-level information. Concretely, we
introduce a hybrid representation called HIQuery to represent all map elements,
and propose a point-element interactor to interactively extract and encode the
hybrid information of elements, e.g. point position and element shape, into the
HIQuery. Additionally, we present a point-element consistency constraint to
enhance the consistency between the point-level and element-level information.
Finally, the output point-element integrated HIQuery can be directly converted
into map elements' class, point coordinates, and mask. We conduct extensive
experiments and consistently outperform previous methods on both nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets. Notably, our method achieves $77.8$ mAP on the nuScenes
dataset, remarkably superior to previous SOTAs by $8.3$ mAP at least.

their reliability, particularly in the generation of long captions. Current
methods fall short of accurately identifying and mitigating these
hallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce ESREAL, a novel
unsupervised learning framework designed to suppress the generation of
hallucinations through accurate localization and penalization of hallucinated
tokens. Initially, ESREAL creates a reconstructed image based on the generated
caption and aligns its corresponding regions with those of the original image.
This semantic reconstruction aids in identifying both the presence and type of
token-level hallucinations within the generated caption. Subsequently, ESREAL
computes token-level hallucination scores by assessing the semantic similarity
of aligned regions based on the type of hallucination. Finally, ESREAL employs
a proximal policy optimization algorithm, where it selectively penalizes
hallucinated tokens according to their token-level hallucination scores. Our
framework notably reduces hallucinations in LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2
by 32.81%, 27.08%, and 7.46% on the CHAIR metric. This improvement is achieved
solely through signals derived from the image itself, without the need for any
image-text pairs.

generation by modeling joint distributions in grid space. In this paper, we
extend auto-regressive models to 3D domains, and seek a stronger ability of 3D
shape generation by improving auto-regressive models at capacity and
scalability simultaneously. Firstly, we leverage an ensemble of publicly
available 3D datasets to facilitate the training of large-scale models. It
consists of a comprehensive collection of approximately 900,000 objects, with
multiple properties of meshes, points, voxels, rendered images, and text
captions. This diverse labeled dataset, termed Objaverse-Mix, empowers our
model to learn from a wide range of object variations. However, directly
applying 3D auto-regression encounters critical challenges of high
computational demands on volumetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order
along grid dimensions, resulting in inferior quality of 3D shapes. To this end,
we then present a novel framework Argus3D in terms of capacity. Concretely, our
approach introduces discrete representation learning based on a latent vector
instead of volumetric grids, which not only reduces computational costs but
also preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distributions
in a more tractable order. The capacity of conditional generation can thus be
realized by simply concatenating various conditioning inputs to the latent
vector, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts. In addition,
thanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we naturally scale up our
approach to a larger model with an impressive 3.6 billion parameters, further
enhancing the quality of versatile 3D generation. Extensive experiments on four
generation tasks demonstrate that Argus3D can synthesize diverse and faithful
shapes across multiple categories, achieving remarkable performance.

mechanism to synthesize the reactive body and hand motion of the second person,
thereby completing the interactions between the two. We demonstrate ReMoS
across challenging two-person scenarios such as pair-dancing, Ninjutsu,
kickboxing, and acrobatics, where one person's movements have complex and
diverse influences on the other. We also contribute the ReMoCap dataset for
two-person interactions containing full-body and finger motions. We evaluate
ReMoS through multiple quantitative metrics, qualitative visualizations, and a
user study, and also indicate usability in interactive motion editing
applications.

                                        <span>  Chest X-ray images are commonly used for predicting acute and chronic
cardiopulmonary conditions, but efforts to integrate them with structured
clinical data face challenges due to incomplete electronic health records
(EHR). This paper introduces \textbf{MedPromptX}, the first model to integrate
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot prompting (FP) and visual
grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for chest X-ray diagnosis. A
pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing EHR information,
providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical history.
Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs while
effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the process of
determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting high-quality
candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model performance.
Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines few-shot data for
real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG aids in focusing
the model's attention on relevant regions of interest in X-ray images,
enhancing the identification of abnormalities. We release MedPromptX-VQA, a new
in-context visual question answering dataset encompassing interleaved image and
EHR data derived from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR databases. Results demonstrate the
SOTA performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score
compared to the baselines. Code and data are available at

manufacturing. Our method utilizes text information about the target object,

from textual and image-based knowledge, ensuring stability and generality.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing

the target person in more realistic surveillance scenarios, where pedestrians
usually change their clothing. Despite great progress, limited cloth-changing
training samples in existing CC-ReID datasets still prevent the model from
adequately learning cloth-irrelevant features. In addition, due to the absence
of explicit supervision to keep the model constantly focused on
cloth-irrelevant areas, existing methods are still hampered by the disruption
of clothing variations. To solve the above issues, we propose an Identity-aware
Dual-constraint Network (IDNet) for the CC-ReID task. Specifically, to help the
model extract cloth-irrelevant clues, we propose a Clothes Diversity
Augmentation (CDA), which generates more realistic cloth-changing samples by
enriching the clothing color while preserving the texture. In addition, a
Multi-scale Constraint Block (MCB) is designed, which extracts fine-grained
identity-related features and effectively transfers cloth-irrelevant knowledge.
Moreover, a Counterfactual-guided Attention Module (CAM) is presented, which
learns cloth-irrelevant features from channel and space dimensions and utilizes
the counterfactual intervention for supervising the attention map to highlight
identity-related regions. Finally, a Semantic Alignment Constraint (SAC) is
designed to facilitate high-level semantic feature interaction. Comprehensive
experiments on four CC-ReID datasets indicate that our method outperforms prior
state-of-the-art approaches.

continues to rise, recent research efforts have pivoted towards developing
methodologies to edit implicit knowledge embedded within LLMs. Yet, there's
still a dark cloud lingering overhead -- will knowledge editing trigger
butterfly effect? since it is still unclear whether knowledge editing might
introduce side effects that pose potential risks or not. This paper pioneers
the investigation into the potential pitfalls associated with knowledge editing
for LLMs. To achieve this, we introduce new benchmark datasets and propose
innovative evaluation metrics. Our results underline two pivotal concerns: (1)
Knowledge Conflict: Editing groups of facts that logically clash can magnify
the inherent inconsistencies in LLMs-a facet neglected by previous methods. (2)
Knowledge Distortion: Altering parameters with the aim of editing factual
knowledge can irrevocably warp the innate knowledge structure of LLMs.
Experimental results vividly demonstrate that knowledge editing might
inadvertently cast a shadow of unintended consequences on LLMs, which warrant
attention and efforts for future works. Code and data are available at

predicting their 6-DoF poses for assembling a realistic 3D shape. Prior work
often focus on the geometry of individual parts, neglecting part-whole
hierarchies of objects. Leveraging two key observations: 1) super-part poses
provide strong hints about part poses, and 2) predicting super-part poses is
easier due to fewer superparts, we propose a part-whole-hierarchy message
passing network for efficient 3D part assembly. We first introduce super-parts
by grouping geometrically similar parts without any semantic labels. Then we
employ a part-whole hierarchical encoder, wherein a super-part encoder predicts
latent super-part poses based on input parts. Subsequently, we transform the
point cloud using the latent poses, feeding it to the part encoder for
aggregating super-part information and reasoning about part relationships to
predict all part poses. In training, only ground-truth part poses are required.
During inference, the predicted latent poses of super-parts enhance
interpretability. Experimental results on the PartNet dataset show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in part and connectivity accuracy
and enables an interpretable hierarchical part assembly.

text-specified objects from 360-degree Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). The
challenge is to effectively remove objects while inpainting perceptually
consistent content for the missing regions, which is particularly demanding for
existing NeRF models due to their implicit volumetric representation. Moreover,
unbounded scenes are more prone to floater artifacts in the inpainted region
than frontal-facing scenes, as the change of object appearance and background
across views is more sensitive to inaccurate segmentations and inconsistent
inpainting. With a trained NeRF and a text description, our method efficiently
removes specified objects and inpaints visually consistent content without
artifacts. We apply depth-space warping to enforce consistency across multiview
text-encoded segmentations, and then refine the inpainted NeRF model using
perceptual priors and 3D diffusion-based geometric priors to ensure visual
plausibility. Through extensive experiments in segmentation and inpainting on
360-degree and frontal-facing NeRFs, we show that our approach is effective and
enhances NeRF's editability. Project page: https://ivrl.github.io/InNeRF360.

                                        <span>  Passive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging has witnessed rapid development in
recent years, due to its ability to image objects that are out of sight. The
light transport condition plays an important role in this task since changing
the conditions will lead to different imaging models. Existing learning-based
NLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport
conditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality
of the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging
method that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a
single network. We achieve this by inferring a latent light transport
representation from the projection image and using this representation to
modulate the network that reconstructs the hidden image from the projection
image. We train a light transport encoder together with a vector quantizer to
obtain the light transport representation. To further regulate this
representation, we jointly learn both the reconstruction network and the
reprojection network during training. A set of light transport modulation
blocks is used to modulate the two jointly trained networks in a multi-scale
way. Extensive experiments on a large-scale passive NLOS dataset demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Aiming to advance AI agents, large foundation models significantly improve
reasoning and instruction execution, yet the current focus on vision and
language neglects the potential of perceiving diverse modalities in open-world
environments. However, the success of data-driven vision and language models is
costly or even infeasible to be reproduced for rare modalities. In this paper,
we present ViT-Lens-2 that facilitates efficient omni-modal representation
learning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT and aligning them
to a pre-defined space. Specifically, the modality-specific lens is tuned to
project any-modal signals to an intermediate embedding space, which are then
processed by a strong ViT with pre-trained visual knowledge. The encoded
representations are optimized toward aligning with the modal-independent space,
pre-defined by off-the-shelf foundation models. ViT-Lens-2 provides a unified
solution for representation learning of increasing modalities with two
appealing advantages: (i) Unlocking the great potential of pretrained ViTs to
novel modalities effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Enabling emergent
downstream capabilities through modality alignment and shared ViT parameters.
We tailor ViT-Lens-2 to learn representations for 3D point cloud, depth, audio,
tactile and EEG, and set new state-of-the-art results across various
understanding tasks, such as zero-shot classification. By seamlessly
integrating ViT-Lens-2 into Multimodal Foundation Models, we enable
Any-modality to Text and Image Generation in a zero-shot manner. Code and

                                        <span>  Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging
cross-modal pedestrian retrieval task, due to significant intra-class
variations and cross-modal discrepancies among different cameras. Existing
works mainly focus on embedding images of different modalities into a unified
space to mine modality-shared features. They only seek distinctive information
within these shared features, while ignoring the identity-aware useful
information that is implicit in the modality-specific features. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Implicit Discriminative Knowledge Learning (IDKL)
network to uncover and leverage the implicit discriminative information
contained within the modality-specific. First, we extract modality-specific and
modality-shared features using a novel dual-stream network. Then, the
modality-specific features undergo purification to reduce their modality style
discrepancies while preserving identity-aware discriminative knowledge.
Subsequently, this kind of implicit knowledge is distilled into the
modality-shared feature to enhance its distinctiveness. Finally, an alignment
loss is proposed to minimize modality discrepancy on enhanced modality-shared
features. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of IDKL network over the state-of-the-art methods. Code is

                                        <span>  Neural field is an emerging paradigm in data representation that trains a
neural network to approximate the given signal. A key obstacle that prevents
its widespread adoption is the encoding speed-generating neural fields requires
an overfitting of a neural network, which can take a significant number of SGD
steps to reach the desired fidelity level. In this paper, we delve into the
impacts of data transformations on the speed of neural field training,
specifically focusing on how permuting pixel locations affect the convergence
speed of SGD. Counterintuitively, we find that randomly permuting the pixel
locations can considerably accelerate the training. To explain this phenomenon,
we examine the neural field training through the lens of PSNR curves, loss
landscapes, and error patterns. Our analyses suggest that the random pixel
permutations remove the easy-to-fit patterns, which facilitate easy
optimization in the early stage but hinder capturing fine details of the
signal.

Translation (AV2AV) framework, where the input and output of the system are
multimodal (i.e., audio and visual speech). With the proposed AV2AV, two key
advantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations with
individuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primary
languages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A), which solely
translates between audio modalities, the proposed AV2AV directly translates
between audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experience
by presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2)
We can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. By
employing the complementary information of audio-visual speech, the system can
effectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise,
showcasing robust performance. To mitigate the problem of the absence of a
parallel AV2AV translation dataset, we propose to train our spoken language
translation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A. This is done by learning
unified audio-visual speech representations through self-supervised learning in
advance to train the translation system. Moreover, we propose an AV-Renderer
that can generate raw audio and video in parallel. It is designed with
zero-shot speaker modeling, thus the speaker in source audio-visual speech can
be maintained at the target translated audio-visual speech. The effectiveness
of AV2AV is evaluated with extensive experiments in a many-to-many language
translation setting. Demo page is available on

                                        <span>  Our goal is to synthesize 3D human motions given textual inputs describing
simultaneous actions, for example 'waving hand' while 'walking' at the same
time. We refer to generating such simultaneous movements as performing 'spatial
compositions'. In contrast to temporal compositions that seek to transition
from one action to another, spatial compositing requires understanding which
body parts are involved in which action, to be able to move them
simultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between
actions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this
knowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as "what are the body parts
involved in the action <action name>?", while also providing the parts list and
few-shot examples. Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from
two motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially
compose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is
always limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further create synthetic data
with this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion
generation model, called SINC ("SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human
motions"). In our experiments, that training with such GPT-guided synthetic
data improves spatial composition generation over baselines. Our code is

                                        <span>  Image compression and denoising represent fundamental challenges in image
processing with many real-world applications. To address practical demands,
current solutions can be categorized into two main strategies: 1) sequential
method; and 2) joint method. However, sequential methods have the disadvantage
of error accumulation as there is information loss between multiple individual
models. Recently, the academic community began to make some attempts to tackle
this problem through end-to-end joint methods. Most of them ignore that
different regions of noisy images have different characteristics. To solve
these problems, in this paper, our proposed signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR) aware
joint solution exploits local and non-local features for image compression and
denoising simultaneously. We design an end-to-end trainable network, which
includes the main encoder branch, the guidance branch, and the signal-to-noise
ratio~(SNR) aware branch. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our joint solution outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods.

their scalability to more modalities (e.g., 3D, audio, etc.) is limited to
large-scale data, which is expensive or even inapplicable for rare modalities.
In this paper, we present ViT-Lens that facilitates efficient omni-modal
representation learning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT
and aligning to a pre-defined space. Specifically, the modality-specific lens
is tuned to project multimodal signals to the shared embedding space, which are
then processed by a strong ViT that carries pre-trained image knowledge. The
encoded multimodal representations are optimized toward aligning with the
modal-independent space, pre-defined by off-the-shelf foundation models. A
well-trained lens with a ViT backbone has the potential to serve as one of
these foundation models, supervising the learning of subsequent modalities.
ViT-Lens provides a unified solution for representation learning of increasing
modalities with two appealing benefits: (i) Exploiting the pretrained ViT
across tasks and domains effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Emergent
downstream capabilities of novel modalities are demonstrated due to the
modality alignment space. We evaluate ViT-Lens in the context of 3D as an
initial verification. In zero-shot 3D classification, ViT-Lens achieves
substantial improvements over previous state-of-the-art, showing 52.0% accuracy
on Objaverse-LVIS, 87.4% on ModelNet40, and 60.6% on ScanObjectNN. Furthermore,
we enable zero-shot 3D question-answering by simply integrating the trained 3D
lens into the InstructBLIP model without any adaptation. We will release the
results of ViT-Lens on more modalities in the near future.

texts is a challenging task in text-to-image synthesis, often hindered by a
focus on emulating existing data distributions. In this paper, we develop a
straightforward yet highly effective method, called \textbf{balance
swap-sampling}. First, we propose a swapping mechanism that generates a novel
combinatorial object image set by randomly exchanging intrinsic elements of two
text embeddings through a cutting-edge diffusion model. Second, we introduce a
balance swapping region to efficiently sample a small subset from the newly
generated image set by balancing CLIP distances between the new images and
their original generations, increasing the likelihood of accepting the
high-quality combinations. Last, we employ a segmentation method to compare
CLIP distances among the segmented components, ultimately selecting the most
promising object from the sampled subset. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach outperforms recent SOTA T2I methods. Surprisingly, our
results even rival those of human artists, such as frog-broccoli.

with the ability to generate regional captions. SAM presents strong
generalizability to segment anything while is short for semantic understanding.
By introducing a lightweight query-based feature mixer, we align the
region-specific features with the embedding space of language models for later
caption generation. As the number of trainable parameters is small (typically
in the order of tens of millions), it costs less computation, less memory
usage, and less communication bandwidth, resulting in both fast and scalable
training. To address the scarcity problem of regional caption data, we propose
to first pre-train our model on objection detection and segmentation tasks. We
call this step weak supervision pretraining since the pre-training data only
contains category names instead of full-sentence descriptions. The weak
supervision pretraining allows us to leverage many publicly available object
detection and segmentation datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority of our method and validate each design choice. This
work serves as a stepping stone towards scaling up regional captioning data and
sheds light on exploring efficient ways to augment SAM with regional semantics.

                                        <span>  The crux of learning vision-language models is to extract semantically
aligned information from visual and linguistic data. Existing attempts usually
face the problem of coarse alignment, e.g., the vision encoder struggles in
localizing an attribute-specified object. In this work, we propose an
embarrassingly simple approach to better align image and text features with no
need of additional data formats other than image-text pairs. Concretely, given
an image and its paired text, we manage to parse objects (e.g., cat) and
attributes (e.g., black) from the description, which are highly likely to exist
in the image. It is noteworthy that the parsing pipeline is fully automatic and
thus enjoys good scalability. With these parsed semantics as supervision
signals, we can complement the commonly used image-text contrastive loss with
the multi-tag classification loss. Extensive experimental results on a broad
suite of semantic segmentation datasets substantiate the average 5.2\%
improvement of our framework over existing alternatives. Furthermore, the
visualization results indicate that attribute supervision makes vision-language
models accurately localize attribute-specified objects. Project page can be

transfer framework that transcends traditional limitations of color,
brushstrokes, and object shape, capturing high-level style elements such as
composition and distinctive artistic expression. The integration of a
multi-level style encoder with our proposed explicit adaptation mechanism
enables ArtAdapter to achieve unprecedented fidelity in style transfer,
ensuring close alignment with textual descriptions. Additionally, the
incorporation of an Auxiliary Content Adapter (ACA) effectively separates
content from style, alleviating the borrowing of content from style references.
Moreover, our novel fast finetuning approach could further enhance zero-shot
style representation while mitigating the risk of overfitting. Comprehensive
evaluations confirm that ArtAdapter surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  To gather a significant quantity of annotated training data for
high-performance image classification models, numerous companies opt to enlist
third-party providers to label their unlabeled data. This practice is widely
regarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the
impact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is
negligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison
the training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image
backdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a
fraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.
Specifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to
divide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those
without it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part
to a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target
model after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the
attacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input
image to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the
trigger feature as input. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of our attacks. According to the experimental
results, we conclude that our attacks seriously jeopardize the fairness and
robustness of image classification models, and it is necessary to be vigilant
about the incorrect labels in outsourced labeling.

image, is an active research topic. Recent deep learning models, trained on
large and varied meta-datasets, now provide excellent performance in the domain
of natural images. However, few datasets exist which provide ground truth depth
for endoscopic images, making training such models from scratch unfeasible.
This work investigates the transfer of these models into the surgical domain,
and presents an effective and simple way to improve on standard supervision
through the use of temporal consistency self-supervision. We show temporal
consistency significantly improves supervised training alone when transferring
to the low-data regime of endoscopy, and outperforms the prevalent
self-supervision technique for this task. In addition we show our method
drastically outperforms the state-of-the-art method from within the domain of
endoscopy. We also release our code, model and ensembled meta-dataset,
Meta-MED, establishing a strong benchmark for future work.

                                        <span>  Domain adaptive semantic segmentation enables robust pixel-wise understanding
in real-world driving scenes. Source-free domain adaptation, as a more
practical technique, addresses the concerns of data privacy and storage
limitations in typical unsupervised domain adaptation methods, making it
especially relevant in the context of intelligent vehicles. It utilizes a
well-trained source model and unlabeled target data to achieve adaptation in
the target domain. However, in the absence of source data and target labels,
current solutions cannot sufficiently reduce the impact of domain shift and
fully leverage the information from the target data. In this paper, we propose
an end-to-end source-free domain adaptation semantic segmentation method via
Importance-Aware and Prototype-Contrast (IAPC) learning. The proposed IAPC
framework effectively extracts domain-invariant knowledge from the well-trained
source model and learns domain-specific knowledge from the unlabeled target
domain. Specifically, considering the problem of domain shift in the prediction
of the target domain by the source model, we put forward an importance-aware
mechanism for the biased target prediction probability distribution to extract
domain-invariant knowledge from the source model. We further introduce a
prototype-contrast strategy, which includes a prototype-symmetric cross-entropy
loss and a prototype-enhanced cross-entropy loss, to learn target intra-domain
knowledge without relying on labels. A comprehensive variety of experiments on
two domain adaptive semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrates that the
proposed end-to-end IAPC solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is publicly available at

keypoints across image pairs. Existing research indicates that the intermediate
output of the UNet within the Stable Diffusion (SD) can serve as robust image
feature maps for such a matching task. We demonstrate that by employing a basic
prompt tuning technique, the inherent potential of Stable Diffusion can be
harnessed, resulting in a significant enhancement in accuracy over previous
approaches. We further introduce a novel conditional prompting module that
conditions the prompt on the local details of the input image pairs, leading to
a further improvement in performance. We designate our approach as SD4Match,
short for Stable Diffusion for Semantic Matching. Comprehensive evaluations of
SD4Match on the PF-Pascal, PF-Willow, and SPair-71k datasets show that it sets
new benchmarks in accuracy across all these datasets. Particularly, SD4Match
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a margin of 12 percentage points

their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness
is critical for their real-world deployment. In this work, we evaluate the
resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background
context variations. The majority of robustness evaluation methods have
introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics
(viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques
(adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in
distributions. Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and
diffusion models to generate changes in the background. However, these methods
either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the
object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task. Our method, on the other
hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the
original semantics and appearance of the object. To achieve this goal, we
harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and
image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of
object-to-background changes. We induce both natural and adversarial background
changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and
textual embedding of text-to-image models. We produce various versions of
standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and
realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and
adversarial changes in the background. We conduct extensive experiment to
analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background
context variations across diverse tasks. Code

language instructions to human body movements. While most existing works are
confined to coarse-grained motion descriptions, e.g., "A man squats.",
fine-grained descriptions specifying movements of relevant body parts are
barely explored. Models trained with coarse-grained texts may not be able to
learn mappings from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives,
resulting in the failure to generate motions from unseen descriptions. In this
paper, we build a large-scale language-motion dataset specializing in
fine-grained textual descriptions, FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with
step-by-step instructions with pseudo-code compulsory checks. Accordingly, we
design a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, making full use of
fine-grained textual information. Our quantitative evaluation shows that
FineMotionDiffuse trained on FineHumanML3D improves FID by a large margin of
0.38, compared with competitive baselines. According to the qualitative
evaluation and case study, our model outperforms MotionDiffuse in generating
spatially or chronologically composite motions, by learning the implicit
mappings from fine-grained descriptions to the corresponding basic motions. We
release our data at https://github.com/KunhangL/finemotiondiffuse.

                                        <span>  The personalization of machine learning (ML) models to address data drift is
a significant challenge in the context of Internet of Things (IoT)
applications. Presently, most approaches focus on fine-tuning either the full
base model or its last few layers to adapt to new data, while often neglecting
energy costs. However, various types of data drift exist, and fine-tuning the
full base model or the last few layers may not result in optimal performance in
certain scenarios. We propose Target Block Fine-Tuning (TBFT), a low-energy
adaptive personalization framework designed for resource-constrained devices.
We categorize data drift and personalization into three types: input-level,
feature-level, and output-level. For each type, we fine-tune different blocks
of the model to achieve optimal performance with reduced energy costs.
Specifically, input-, feature-, and output-level correspond to fine-tuning the
front, middle, and rear blocks of the model. We evaluate TBFT on a ResNet
model, three datasets, three different training sizes, and a Raspberry Pi.
Compared with the $Block Avg$, where each block is fine-tuned individually and
their performance improvements are averaged, TBFT exhibits an improvement in
model accuracy by an average of 15.30% whilst saving 41.57% energy consumption
on average compared with full fine-tuning.

transfer pre-trained models to downstream tasks, avoiding the high cost of
updating entire large-scale pre-trained models (LPMs). In this work, we present
Fine-grained Prompt Tuning (FPT), a novel PEFT method for medical image
classification. FPT significantly reduces memory consumption compared to other
PEFT methods, especially in high-resolution contexts. To achieve this, we first
freeze the weights of the LPM and construct a learnable lightweight side
network. The frozen LPM takes high-resolution images as input to extract
fine-grained features, while the side network is fed low-resolution images to
reduce memory usage. To allow the side network to access pre-trained knowledge,
we introduce fine-grained prompts that summarize information from the LPM
through a fusion module. Important tokens selection and preloading techniques
are employed to further reduce training cost and memory requirements. We
evaluate FPT on four medical datasets with varying sizes, modalities, and
complexities. Experimental results demonstrate that FPT achieves comparable
performance to fine-tuning the entire LPM while using only 1.8% of the
learnable parameters and 13% of the memory costs of an encoder ViT-B model with
a 512 x 512 input resolution.

information. Despite the remarkable progress achieved in medical image
segmentation, there is still an absence of 3D foundation segmentation model
that can segment a wide range of anatomical categories with easy user
interaction. In this paper, we propose a 3D foundation segmentation model,
named SegVol, supporting universal and interactive volumetric medical image
segmentation. By scaling up training data to 90K unlabeled Computed Tomography
(CT) volumes and 6K labeled CT volumes, this foundation model supports the
segmentation of over 200 anatomical categories using semantic and spatial
prompts. Extensive experiments on 10 internal validation tasks and 18 external
validation tasks verify that SegVol outperforms the state of the art by a large
margin. Through its capacity to provide precise volumetric segmentation across
various anatomical categories, SegVol has the potential to accelerate
advancements in medical imaging diagnosis and facilitate treatment
optimization. The model and code are publicly available at:

capable of generating high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, due to the lack of information from multiple views, these works
encounter difficulties in generating controllable novel views. In this paper,
we present DreamComposer, a flexible and scalable framework that can enhance
existing view-aware diffusion models by injecting multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer first uses a view-aware 3D lifting module to obtain
3D representations of an object from multiple views. Then, it renders the
latent features of the target view from 3D representations with the multi-view
feature fusion module. Finally the target view features extracted from
multi-view inputs are injected into a pre-trained diffusion model. Experiments
show that DreamComposer is compatible with state-of-the-art diffusion models
for zero-shot novel view synthesis, further enhancing them to generate
high-fidelity novel view images with multi-view conditions, ready for
controllable 3D object reconstruction and various other applications.

is essential to many perception systems. We propose a novel learning framework
for this task which improves the necessary regularization. Relying on the
assumption that scene elements are mostly rigid, current smoothness losses are
built on the definition of ``rigid clusters" in the input point clouds. The
definition of these clusters is challenging and has a significant impact on the
quality of predicted flows. We introduce two new consistency losses that
enlarge clusters while preventing them from spreading over distinct objects. In
particular, we enforce \emph{temporal} consistency with a forward-backward
cyclic loss and \emph{spatial} consistency by considering surface orientation
similarity in addition to spatial proximity. The proposed losses are
model-independent and can thus be used in a plug-and-play fashion to
significantly improve the performance of existing models, as demonstrated on
two most widely used architectures. We also showcase the effectiveness and
generalization capability of our framework on four standard sensor-unique
driving datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene flow
estimation. Our codes are available on https://github.com/ctu-vras/sac-flow.

a crew of table tennis professionals and referees on a specially designed

every ping-pong action that appeared in the dataset, and formulate two sets of
action detection problems -- \emph{action localization} and \emph{action

TSM, TSN, Video SwinTransformer, and Slowfast) and action localization models
(e.g., BSN, BSN++, BMN, TCANet), using \TheName{} for both problems, under
various settings. These models can only achieve 48\% area under the AR-AN curve

actions are dense with fast-moving subjects but broadcasting videos are with

                                        <span>  Traditionally, training neural networks to perform semantic segmentation
required expensive human-made annotations. But more recently, advances in the
field of unsupervised learning have made significant progress on this issue and
towards closing the gap to supervised algorithms. To achieve this, semantic
knowledge is distilled by learning to correlate randomly sampled features from
images across an entire dataset. In this work, we build upon these advances by
incorporating information about the structure of the scene into the training
process through the use of depth information. We achieve this by (1) learning
depth-feature correlation by spatially correlate the feature maps with the
depth maps to induce knowledge about the structure of the scene and (2)
implementing farthest-point sampling to more effectively select relevant
features by utilizing 3D sampling techniques on depth information of the scene.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical contributions
through extensive experimentation and present significant improvements in
performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

                                        <span>  Reflectance bounds the frequency spectrum of illumination in the object
appearance. In this paper, we introduce the first stochastic inverse rendering
method, which recovers the attenuated frequency spectrum of an illumination
jointly with the reflectance of an object of known geometry from a single
image. Our key idea is to solve this blind inverse problem in the reflectance
map, an appearance representation invariant to the underlying geometry, by
learning to reverse the image formation with a novel diffusion model which we
refer to as the Diffusion Reflectance Map Network (DRMNet). Given an observed
reflectance map converted and completed from the single input image, DRMNet
generates a reflectance map corresponding to a perfect mirror sphere while
jointly estimating the reflectance. The forward process can be understood as
gradually filtering a natural illumination with lower and lower frequency
reflectance and additive Gaussian noise. DRMNet learns to invert this process
with two subnetworks, IllNet and RefNet, which work in concert towards this
joint estimation. The network is trained on an extensive synthetic dataset and
is demonstrated to generalize to real images, showing state-of-the-art accuracy
on established datasets.

segmentation, which provides significant assistance and reference value for
clinical surgery. However, accurate segmentation of polyps is a challenging
task due to two main reasons. Firstly, polyps exhibit various shapes and
colors. Secondly, the boundaries between polyps and their normal surroundings
are often unclear. Additionally, significant differences between different
datasets lead to limited generalization capabilities of existing methods. To
address these issues, we propose a segmentation model based on Prompt-Mamba,
which incorporates the latest Vision-Mamba and prompt technologies. Compared to
previous models trained on the same dataset, our model not only maintains high
segmentation accuracy on the validation part of the same dataset but also
demonstrates superior accuracy on unseen datasets, exhibiting excellent
generalization capabilities. Notably, we are the first to apply the
Vision-Mamba architecture to polyp segmentation and the first to utilize prompt
technology in a polyp segmentation model. Our model efficiently accomplishes
segmentation tasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by an average
of 5% across six datasets. Furthermore, we have developed multiple versions of
our model with scaled parameter counts, achieving better performance than
previous models even with fewer parameters. Our code and trained weights will
be released soon.

                                        <span>  Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians and cars in
complex scenes has become more and more significant in many intelligent systems
and applications. The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive
behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than
other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of
efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories
through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem
has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the
positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new
anglebased trainable social interaction representation, named SocialCircle, for
continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular
orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the
proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released
trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not
only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively
helps better simulate social interactions when forecasting pedestrian
trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.

improvements for the personalised saliency prediction task. However, prior
works require explicit user characteristics and preferences as input, which are
often difficult to obtain. We present a novel method to extract user embeddings
from pairs of natural images and corresponding saliency maps generated from a
small amount of user-specific eye tracking data. At the core of our method is a
Siamese convolutional neural encoder that learns the user embeddings by
contrasting the image and personal saliency map pairs of different users.
Evaluations on two public saliency datasets show that the generated embeddings
have high discriminative power, are effective at refining universal saliency
maps to the individual users, and generalise well across users and images.
Finally, based on our model's ability to encode individual user
characteristics, our work points towards other applications that can benefit
from reusable embeddings of gaze behaviour.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a novel Visual Reference Prompt (VRP) encoder that
empowers the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to utilize annotated reference images
as prompts for segmentation, creating the VRP-SAM model. In essence, VRP-SAM
can utilize annotated reference images to comprehend specific objects and
perform segmentation of specific objects in target image. It is note that the
VRP encoder can support a variety of annotation formats for reference images,
including \textbf{point}, \textbf{box}, \textbf{scribble}, and \textbf{mask}.
VRP-SAM achieves a breakthrough within the SAM framework by extending its
versatility and applicability while preserving SAM's inherent strengths, thus
enhancing user-friendliness. To enhance the generalization ability of VRP-SAM,
the VRP encoder adopts a meta-learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness
of VRP-SAM, we conducted extensive empirical studies on the Pascal and COCO
datasets. Remarkably, VRP-SAM achieved state-of-the-art performance in visual
reference segmentation with minimal learnable parameters. Furthermore, VRP-SAM
demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform
segmentation of unseen objects and enabling cross-domain segmentation. The

                                        <span>  We propose Semantic Facial Feature Control (SeFFeC) - a novel method for
fine-grained face shape editing. Our method enables the manipulation of
human-understandable, semantic face features, such as nose length or mouth
width, which are defined by different groups of facial landmarks. In contrast
to existing methods, the use of facial landmarks enables precise measurement of
the facial features, which then enables training SeFFeC without any manually
annotated labels. SeFFeC consists of a transformer-based encoder network that
takes a latent vector of a pre-trained generative model and a facial feature
embedding as input, and learns to modify the latent vector to perform the
desired face edit operation. To ensure that the desired feature measurement is
changed towards the target value without altering uncorrelated features, we
introduced a novel semantic face feature loss. Qualitative and quantitative
results show that SeFFeC enables precise and fine-grained control of 23 facial
features, some of which could not previously be controlled by other methods,
without requiring manual annotations. Unlike existing methods, SeFFeC also
provides deterministic control over the exact values of the facial features and
more localised and disentangled face edits.

                                        <span>  Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect and segment the
most salient object in videos. The primary techniques used in unsupervised VOS
are 1) the collaboration of appearance and motion information; and 2) temporal
fusion between different frames. This paper proposes two novel prototype-based
attention mechanisms, inter-modality attention (IMA) and inter-frame attention
(IFA), to incorporate these techniques via dense propagation across different
modalities and frames. IMA densely integrates context information from
different modalities based on a mutual refinement. IFA injects global context
of a video to the query frame, enabling a full utilization of useful properties
from multiple frames. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all existing methods by a
substantial margin. The proposed two components are also thoroughly validated
via ablative study.

                                        <span>  In recent years, self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
distinguished paradigm in the artificial intelligence landscape. It facilitates
unsupervised feature learning through contrastive delineations at the instance
level. However, crafting an effective self-supervised paradigm remains a
pivotal challenge within this field. This paper delves into two crucial factors
impacting self-supervised contrastive learning-bach size and pretext tasks, and
from a data processing standpoint, proposes an adaptive technique of batch
fusion. The proposed method, via dimensionality reduction and reconstruction of
batch data, enables formerly isolated individual data to partake in intra-batch
communication through the Embedding Layer. Moreover, it adaptively amplifies
the self-supervised feature encoding capability as the training progresses. We
conducted a linear classification test of this method based on the classic
contrastive learning framework on ImageNet-1k. The empirical findings
illustrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under
equitable comparisons. Benefiting from its "plug-and-play" characteristics, we
further explored other contrastive learning methods. On the ImageNet-100,
compared to the original performance, the top1 has seen a maximum increase of
1.25%. We suggest that the proposed method may contribute to the advancement of
data-driven self-supervised learning research, bringing a fresh perspective to
this community.

models (LLMs) in few-shot segmentation. In contrast to the conventional
few-shot segmentation methods that only rely on the limited and biased
information from the annotated support images, LLaFS leverages the vast prior
knowledge gained by LLM as an effective supplement and directly uses the LLM to
segment images in a few-shot manner. To enable the text-based LLM to handle
image-related tasks, we carefully design an input instruction that allows the
LLM to produce segmentation results represented as polygons, and propose a
region-attribute table to simulate the human visual mechanism and provide
multi-modal guidance. We also synthesize pseudo samples and use curriculum
learning for pretraining to augment data and achieve better optimization. LLaFS
achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets, showing the potential
of using LLMs for few-shot computer vision tasks.

intricacies and complexities in system deployment. We propose a
difficulty-aware edge-cloud collaborative sensing system that splits the task
into object localization and fine-grained classification. Objects are
classified either at the edge or within the cloud, based on their estimated
difficulty. The framework comprises a low-power device-tailored front-end model
for object localization, classification, and difficulty estimation, along with
a transformer-graph convolutional network-based back-end model for fine-grained
classification. Our system demonstrates superior performance (mAP@0.5 +4.3%})
on widely used marine object detection datasets, significantly reducing both
data transmission volume (by 95.43%) and energy consumption (by 72.7%}) at the
system level. We validate the proposed system across various embedded system
platforms and in real-world scenarios involving drone deployment.

we propose Hierarchical MHSA (H-MHSA), a novel approach that computes

Then, the proposed H-MHSA learns token relationships within local patches,
serving as local relationship modeling. Then, the small patches are merged into
larger ones, and H-MHSA models the global dependencies for the small number of
the merged tokens. At last, the local and global attentive features are
aggregated to obtain features with powerful representation capacity. Since we
only calculate attention for a limited number of tokens at each step, the
computational load is reduced dramatically. Hence, H-MHSA can efficiently model
global relationships among tokens without sacrificing fine-grained information.
With the H-MHSA module incorporated, we build a family of
Hierarchical-Attention-based Transformer Networks, namely HAT-Net. To
demonstrate the superiority of HAT-Net in scene understanding, we conduct
extensive experiments on fundamental vision tasks, including image
classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance
segmentation. Therefore, HAT-Net provides a new perspective for vision
transformers. Code and pretrained models are available at

                                        <span>  Fine-tuning pre-trained neural network models has become a widely adopted
approach across various domains. However, it can lead to the distortion of
pre-trained feature extractors that already possess strong generalization
capabilities. Mitigating feature distortion during adaptation to new target
domains is crucial. Recent studies have shown promising results in handling
feature distortion by aligning the head layer on in-distribution datasets
before performing fine-tuning. Nonetheless, a significant limitation arises
from the treatment of batch normalization layers during fine-tuning, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Domain-Aware Fine-Tuning
(DAFT), a novel approach that incorporates batch normalization conversion and
the integration of linear probing and fine-tuning. Our batch normalization
conversion method effectively mitigates feature distortion by reducing
modifications to the neural network during fine-tuning. Additionally, we
introduce the integration of linear probing and fine-tuning to optimize the
head layer with gradual adaptation of the feature extractor. By leveraging
batch normalization layers and integrating linear probing and fine-tuning, our
DAFT significantly mitigates feature distortion and achieves improved model
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other baseline methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness in not only improving performance but also
mitigating feature distortion.

neural surfaces using pre-integrated rendering from multi-view images or video.
Unlike methods based on NeRF and discrete meshes, our method utilizes implicit
neural surface representation to reconstruct high-quality geometry, which
facilitates the factorization of the radiance field into two components: a
spatially varying material field and an all-frequency lighting representation.
This factorization, jointly optimized using an adapted differentiable
pre-integrated rendering framework with material encoding regularization, in
turn addresses the ambiguity of geometry reconstruction and leads to better
disentanglement and refinement of each scene property. Additionally, we
introduced a method to distil indirect illumination fields from the learned
representations, further recovering the complex illumination effect like
inter-reflection. Consequently, our method enables advanced applications such
as relighting, which can be seamlessly integrated with modern graphics engines.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments have shown that NeuS-PIR outperforms
existing methods across various tasks on both synthetic and real datasets.

shedding light on the cognitive processes behind human actions. The integration
of gaze guidance with the dynamics of hand-object interactions boosts the
accuracy of human motion prediction. However, the lack of datasets that capture
the intricate relationship and consistency among gaze, hand, and object
movements remains a substantial hurdle. In this paper, we introduce the first
Gaze-guided Hand-Object Interaction dataset, GazeHOI, and present a novel task
for synthesizing gaze-guided hand-object interactions. Our dataset, GazeHOI,
features simultaneous 3D modeling of gaze, hand, and object interactions,
comprising 479 sequences with an average duration of 19.1 seconds, 812
sub-sequences, and 33 objects of various sizes. We propose a hierarchical
framework centered on a gaze-guided hand-object interaction diffusion model,
named GHO-Diffusion. In the pre-diffusion phase, we separate gaze conditions
into spatial-temporal features and goal pose conditions at different levels of
information granularity. During the diffusion phase, two gaze-conditioned
diffusion models are stacked to simplify the complex synthesis of hand-object
motions. Here, the object motion diffusion model generates sequences of object
motions based on gaze conditions, while the hand motion diffusion model
produces hand motions based on the generated object motion. To improve
fine-grained goal pose alignment, we introduce a Spherical Gaussian constraint
to guide the denoising step. In the subsequent post-diffusion phase, we
optimize the generated hand motions using contact consistency. Our extensive
experiments highlight the uniqueness of our dataset and the effectiveness of
our approach.

perceptible, which provides humans with a spatially dense and holistic
understanding of small motions in the scene of interest. This is based on the
premise that magnifying small motions enhances the legibility of motions. In
the real world, however, vibrating objects often possess convoluted systems
that have complex natural frequencies, modes, and directions. Existing motion
magnification often fails to improve legibility since the intricate motions
still retain complex characteristics even after being magnified, which may
distract us from analyzing them. In this work, we focus on improving legibility
by proposing a new concept, axial motion magnification, which magnifies
decomposed motions along the user-specified direction. Axial motion
magnification can be applied to various applications where motions of specific
axes are critical, by providing simplified and easily readable motion
information. To achieve this, we propose a novel Motion Separation Module that
enables to disentangle and magnify the motion representation along axes of
interest. Furthermore, we build a new synthetic training dataset for the axial
motion magnification task. Our proposed method improves the legibility of
resulting motions along certain axes by adding a new feature: user
controllability. Axial motion magnification is a more generalized concept;
thus, our method can be directly adapted to the generic motion magnification
and achieves favorable performance against competing methods.

it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for
malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today,
the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the
ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real
and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are
to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We
conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate
people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and
audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which
people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions
and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used
in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between
synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance
worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic
content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single
modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to
being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages
as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that
prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection
performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly
susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that
human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an
effective counterdefense.

machines or different operational states, making it challenging to learn
through federated learning or split learning. In our proposed method, each
client calculates embeddings using a common pre-trained model developed for
sound data classification, and these calculated embeddings are aggregated on
the server to perform anomalous sound detection through outlier exposure.
Experiments showed that our proposed method improves the AUC of anomalous sound
detection by an average of 6.8%.

                                        <span>  A generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoder trained with an
adversarial discriminator is commonly used for speech synthesis because of its
fast, lightweight, and high-quality characteristics. However, this data-driven
model requires a large amount of training data incurring high data-collection
costs. This fact motivates us to train a GAN-based vocoder on limited data. A
promising solution is to augment the training data to avoid overfitting.
However, a standard discriminator is unconditional and insensitive to
distributional changes caused by data augmentation. Thus, augmented speech
(which can be extraordinary) may be considered real speech. To address this
issue, we propose an augmentation-conditional discriminator (AugCondD) that
receives the augmentation state as input in addition to speech, thereby
assessing the input speech according to the augmentation state, without
inhibiting the learning of the original non-augmented distribution.
Experimental results indicate that AugCondD improves speech quality under
limited data conditions while achieving comparable speech quality under
sufficient data conditions. Audio samples are available at

                                        <span>  We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot
text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft
employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement
procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable
generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft
produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited
recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS,
our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular
commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging
and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles,
recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs
consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular,
for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and
realistic dataset named RealEdit. We encourage readers to listen to the demos

                                        <span>  The front-end is a critical component of English text-to-speech (TTS)
systems, responsible for extracting linguistic features that are essential for
a text-to-speech model to synthesize speech, such as prosodies and phonemes.
The English TTS front-end typically consists of a text normalization (TN)
module, a prosody word prosody phrase (PWPP) module, and a grapheme-to-phoneme
(G2P) module. However, current research on the English TTS front-end focuses
solely on individual modules, neglecting the interdependence between them and
resulting in sub-optimal performance for each module. Therefore, this paper
proposes a unified front-end framework that captures the dependencies among the
English TTS front-end modules. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all modules.

                                        <span>  Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoders have been intensively
studied because they can synthesize high-fidelity audio waveforms faster than
real-time. However, it has been reported that most GANs fail to obtain the
optimal projection for discriminating between real and fake data in the feature
space. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that slicing adversarial
network (SAN), an improved GAN training framework that can find the optimal
projection, is effective in the image generation task. In this paper, we
investigate the effectiveness of SAN in the vocoding task. For this purpose, we
propose a scheme to modify least-squares GAN, which most GAN-based vocoders
adopt, so that their loss functions satisfy the requirements of SAN. Through
our experiments, we demonstrate that SAN can improve the performance of
GAN-based vocoders, including BigVGAN, with small modifications. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sony/bigvsan.

their remarkable success in tasks that required estimating and sampling data
distribution to generate high-fidelity synthetic data. In speech,
text-to-speech synthesis and neural vocoder are good examples where generative
models have shined. While generative models have been applied to different
applications in speech, there exists no general-purpose generative model that
models speech directly. In this work, we take a step toward this direction by
showing a single pre-trained generative model can be adapted to different
downstream tasks with strong performance. Specifically, we pre-trained a
generative model, named SpeechFlow, on 60k hours of untranscribed speech with
Flow Matching and masked conditions. Experiment results show the pre-trained
generative model can be fine-tuned with task-specific data to match or surpass
existing expert models on speech enhancement, separation, and synthesis. Our
work suggested a foundational model for generation tasks in speech can be built
with generative pre-training.

                                        <span>  A generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoder trained with an
adversarial discriminator is commonly used for speech synthesis because of its
fast, lightweight, and high-quality characteristics. However, this data-driven
model requires a large amount of training data incurring high data-collection
costs. This fact motivates us to train a GAN-based vocoder on limited data. A
promising solution is to augment the training data to avoid overfitting.
However, a standard discriminator is unconditional and insensitive to
distributional changes caused by data augmentation. Thus, augmented speech
(which can be extraordinary) may be considered real speech. To address this
issue, we propose an augmentation-conditional discriminator (AugCondD) that
receives the augmentation state as input in addition to speech, thereby
assessing the input speech according to the augmentation state, without
inhibiting the learning of the original non-augmented distribution.
Experimental results indicate that AugCondD improves speech quality under
limited data conditions while achieving comparable speech quality under
sufficient data conditions. Audio samples are available at

                                        <span>  We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot
text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft
employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement
procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable
generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft
produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited
recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS,
our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular
commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging
and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles,
recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs
consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular,
for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and
realistic dataset named RealEdit. We encourage readers to listen to the demos

                                        <span>  Interpretability research has shown that self-supervised Spoken Language
Models (SLMs) encode a wide variety of features in human speech from the
acoustic, phonetic, phonological, syntactic and semantic levels, to speaker
characteristics. The bulk of prior research on representations of phonology has
focused on segmental features such as phonemes; the encoding of suprasegmental
phonology (such as tone and stress patterns) in SLMs is not yet well
understood. Tone is a suprasegmental feature that is present in more than half
of the world's languages. This paper aims to analyze the tone encoding
capabilities of SLMs, using Mandarin and Vietnamese as case studies. We show
that SLMs encode lexical tone to a significant degree even when they are
trained on data from non-tonal languages. We further find that SLMs behave
similarly to native and non-native human participants in tone and consonant
perception studies, but they do not follow the same developmental trajectory.

                                        <span>  The front-end is a critical component of English text-to-speech (TTS)
systems, responsible for extracting linguistic features that are essential for
a text-to-speech model to synthesize speech, such as prosodies and phonemes.
The English TTS front-end typically consists of a text normalization (TN)
module, a prosody word prosody phrase (PWPP) module, and a grapheme-to-phoneme
(G2P) module. However, current research on the English TTS front-end focuses
solely on individual modules, neglecting the interdependence between them and
resulting in sub-optimal performance for each module. Therefore, this paper
proposes a unified front-end framework that captures the dependencies among the
English TTS front-end modules. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all modules.

studied because they can synthesize high-fidelity audio waveforms faster than
real-time. However, it has been reported that most GANs fail to obtain the
optimal projection for discriminating between real and fake data in the feature
space. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that slicing adversarial
network (SAN), an improved GAN training framework that can find the optimal
projection, is effective in the image generation task. In this paper, we
investigate the effectiveness of SAN in the vocoding task. For this purpose, we
propose a scheme to modify least-squares GAN, which most GAN-based vocoders
adopt, so that their loss functions satisfy the requirements of SAN. Through
our experiments, we demonstrate that SAN can improve the performance of
GAN-based vocoders, including BigVGAN, with small modifications. Our code is

their remarkable success in tasks that required estimating and sampling data
distribution to generate high-fidelity synthetic data. In speech,
text-to-speech synthesis and neural vocoder are good examples where generative
models have shined. While generative models have been applied to different
applications in speech, there exists no general-purpose generative model that
models speech directly. In this work, we take a step toward this direction by
showing a single pre-trained generative model can be adapted to different
downstream tasks with strong performance. Specifically, we pre-trained a
generative model, named SpeechFlow, on 60k hours of untranscribed speech with
Flow Matching and masked conditions. Experiment results show the pre-trained
generative model can be fine-tuned with task-specific data to match or surpass
existing expert models on speech enhancement, separation, and synthesis. Our
work suggested a foundational model for generation tasks in speech can be built
with generative pre-training.

                                        <span>  Object reconstruction is relevant for many autonomous robotic tasks that
require interaction with the environment. A key challenge in such scenarios is
planning view configurations to collect informative measurements for
reconstructing an initially unknown object. One-shot view planning enables
efficient data collection by predicting view configurations and planning the
globally shortest path connecting all views at once. However, geometric priors
about the object are required to conduct one-shot view planning. In this work,
we propose a novel one-shot view planning approach that utilizes the powerful
3D generation capabilities of diffusion models as priors. By incorporating such
geometric priors into our pipeline, we achieve effective one-shot view planning
starting with only a single RGB image of the object to be reconstructed. Our
planning experiments in simulation and real-world setups indicate that our
approach balances well between object reconstruction quality and movement cost.

                                        <span>  Curb detection is an important function in intelligent driving and can be
used to determine drivable areas of the road. However, curbs are difficult to
detect due to the complex road environment. This paper introduces CurbNet, a
novel framework for curb detection, leveraging point cloud segmentation.
Addressing the dearth of comprehensive curb datasets and the absence of 3D
annotations, we have developed the 3D-Curb dataset, encompassing 7,100 frames,
which represents the largest and most categorically diverse collection of curb
point clouds currently available. Recognizing that curbs are primarily
characterized by height variations, our approach harnesses spatially-rich 3D
point clouds for training. To tackle the challenges presented by the uneven
distribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their reliance on z-axis
high-frequency features, we introduce the multi-scale and channel attention
(MSCA) module, a bespoke solution designed to optimize detection performance.
Moreover, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group, specifically
formulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds
relative to other categories. Our extensive experimentation on 2 major datasets
has yielded results that surpass existing benchmarks set by leading curb
detection and point cloud segmentation models. By integrating multi-clustering
and curve fitting techniques in our post-processing stage, we have
substantially reduced noise in curb detection, thereby enhancing precision to
0.8744. Notably, CurbNet has achieved an exceptional average metrics of over
0.95 at a tolerance of just 0.15m, thereby establishing a new benchmark.
Furthermore, corroborative real-world experiments and dataset analyzes mutually
validate each other, solidifying CurbNet's superior detection proficiency and
its robust generalizability.

                                        <span>  Event-based semantic segmentation has gained popularity due to its capability
to deal with scenarios under high-speed motion and extreme lighting conditions,
which cannot be addressed by conventional RGB cameras. Since it is hard to
annotate event data, previous approaches rely on event-to-image reconstruction
to obtain pseudo labels for training. However, this will inevitably introduce
noise, and learning from noisy pseudo labels, especially when generated from a
single source, may reinforce the errors. This drawback is also called
confirmation bias in pseudo-labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid
pseudo-labeling framework for unsupervised event-based semantic segmentation,
HPL-ESS, to alleviate the influence of noisy pseudo labels. In particular, we
first employ a plain unsupervised domain adaptation framework as our baseline,
which can generate a set of pseudo labels through self-training. Then, we
incorporate offline event-to-image reconstruction into the framework, and
obtain another set of pseudo labels by predicting segmentation maps on the
reconstructed images. A noisy label learning strategy is designed to mix the
two sets of pseudo labels and enhance the quality. Moreover, we propose a soft
prototypical alignment module to further improve the consistency of target
domain features. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on the
DSEC-Semantic dataset (+5.88% accuracy, +10.32% mIoU), which even surpasses
several supervised methods.

robustness of deep neural networks. While the impact of these attacks on model
predictions has been extensively studied, their effect on the learned
representations and concepts within these models remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the influence of AAs on the
concepts learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using eXplainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. Through an extensive set of
experiments across various network architectures and targeted AA techniques, we
unveil several key findings. First, AAs induce substantial alterations in the
concept composition within the feature space, introducing new concepts or
modifying existing ones. Second, the adversarial perturbation itself can be
linearly decomposed into a set of latent vector components, with a subset of
these being responsible for the attack's success. Notably, we discover that
these components are target-specific, i.e., are similar for a given target
class throughout different AA techniques and starting classes. Our findings
provide valuable insights into the nature of AAs and their impact on learned
representations, paving the way for the development of more robust and
interpretable deep learning models, as well as effective defenses against
adversarial threats.

                                        <span>  Anatomical atlases are widely used for population analysis. Conditional
atlases target a particular sub-population defined via certain conditions (e.g.
demographics or pathologies) and allow for the investigation of fine-grained
anatomical differences - such as morphological changes correlated with age.
Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are unable to
handle large anatomical variations or generative models, which can suffer from
training instabilities and hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we
use latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a
general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. By
generating a deformation field and registering the conditional atlas to a
neighbourhood of images, we ensure structural plausibility and avoid
hallucinations, which can occur during direct image synthesis. We compare our
method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods in experiments
using 5000 brain as well as whole-body MR images from UK Biobank. Our method
generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high
anatomical fidelity, outperforming the baselines.

real-world surgery, also referred to as a surgical digital twin (SDT). It has
significant applications in various fields such as education and training,
surgical planning, and automation of surgical tasks. Given their detailed
representations of surgical procedures, SDTs are an ideal foundation for
machine learning methods, enabling automatic generation of training data. In
robotic surgery, SDTs can provide realistic virtual environments in which
robots may learn through trial and error. In this paper, we present a proof of
concept (PoC) for surgery digitalization that is applied to an ex-vivo spinal
surgery performed in realistic conditions. The proposed digitalization focuses
on the acquisition and modelling of the geometry and appearance of the entire
surgical scene. We employ five RGB-D cameras for dynamic 3D reconstruction of
the surgeon, a high-end camera for 3D reconstruction of the anatomy, an
infrared stereo camera for surgical instrument tracking, and a laser scanner
for 3D reconstruction of the operating room and data fusion. We justify the
proposed methodology, discuss the challenges faced and further extensions of
our prototype. While our PoC partially relies on manual data curation, its high
quality and great potential motivate the development of automated methods for
the creation of SDTs. The quality of our SDT can be assessed in a rendered

                                        <span>  Source-Free Domain Generalization (SFDG) aims to develop a model that works
for unseen target domains without relying on any source domain. Recent work,
PromptStyler, employs text prompts to simulate different distribution shifts in
the joint vision-language space, allowing the model to generalize effectively
to unseen domains without using any images. However, 1) PromptStyler's style
generation strategy has limitations, as all style patterns are fixed after the
first training phase. This leads to the training set in the second training
phase being restricted to a limited set of styles. Additionally, 2) the frozen
text encoder in PromptStyler result in the encoder's output varying with the
style of the input text prompts, making it difficult for the model to learn
domain-invariant features. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic PromptStyler
(DPStyler), comprising Style Generation and Style Removal modules to address
these issues. The Style Generation module refreshes all styles at every
training epoch, while the Style Removal module eliminates variations in the
encoder's output features caused by input styles. Moreover, since the Style
Generation module, responsible for generating style word vectors using random
sampling or style mixing, makes the model sensitive to input text prompts, we
introduce a model ensemble method to mitigate this sensitivity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on benchmark datasets.

explores the potential of 11 deep neural network architectures for automated

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to learn
user-specific preferences (e.g., "good parking spot", "convenient drop-off
location") from visual input. Despite its similarity to learning factual
concepts (e.g., "red cube"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder
problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific
training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse,
which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential
concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as
neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over
images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language
models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual
preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a
user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and
autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly
outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations. The code and other

promising opportunities for clinical decision support and enhancing diagnostic
workflows. Previous studies already demonstrated AI's potential for automated
Gleason grading, but lack state-of-the-art methodology and model reusability.
To address this issue, we propose DeepGleason: an open-source deep neural
network based image classification system for automated Gleason grading using
whole-slide histopathology images from prostate tissue sections. Implemented
with the standardized AUCMEDI framework, our tool employs a tile-wise
classification approach utilizing fine-tuned image preprocessing techniques in
combination with a ConvNeXt architecture which was compared to various
state-of-the-art architectures. The neural network model was trained and
validated on an in-house dataset of 34,264 annotated tiles from 369 prostate
carcinoma slides. We demonstrated that DeepGleason is capable of highly
accurate and reliable Gleason grading with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.806,
AUC of 0.991, and Accuracy of 0.974. The internal architecture comparison
revealed that the ConvNeXt model was superior performance-wise on our dataset
to established and other modern architectures like transformers. Furthermore,
we were able to outperform the current state-of-the-art in tile-wise
fine-classification with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.98 for
benign vs malignant detection as well as of 0.91 and 0.75 for Gleason 3 vs
Gleason 4 & 5 classification, respectively. Our tool contributes to the wider
adoption of AI-based Gleason grading within the research community and paves
the way for broader clinical application of deep learning models in digital
pathology. DeepGleason is open-source and publicly available for research
application in the following Git repository:

regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As
constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck.
Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to
reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However,
current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude
filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks.
  This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression
method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution
satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and
leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible
overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with
competitive scores on perceptual quality measures at lower bitrates. We
extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of
intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we
test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors.
We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without
relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.

                                        <span>  Visual detection of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) has attracted increasing
attention in recent years due to its important application in various tasks.
The existing methods for MAV detection assume that the training set and testing
set have the same distribution. As a result, when deployed in new domains, the
detectors would have a significant performance degradation due to domain
discrepancy. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-domain MAV detection.
The contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) We propose a
Multi-MAV-Multi-Domain (M3D) dataset consisting of both simulation and
realistic images. Compared to other existing datasets, the proposed one is more
comprehensive in the sense that it covers rich scenes, diverse MAV types, and
various viewing angles. A new benchmark for cross-domain MAV detection is
proposed based on the proposed dataset. 2) We propose a Noise Suppression
Network (NSN) based on the framework of pseudo-labeling and a large-to-small
training procedure. To reduce the challenging pseudo-label noises, two novel
modules are designed in this network. The first is a prior-based curriculum
learning module for allocating adaptive thresholds for pseudo labels with
different difficulties. The second is a masked copy-paste augmentation module
for pasting truly-labeled MAVs on unlabeled target images and thus decreasing
pseudo-label noises. 3) Extensive experimental results verify the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art ones. In
particular, it achieves mAP of 46.9%(+5.8%), 50.5%(+3.7%), and 61.5%(+11.3%) on
the tasks of simulation-to-real adaptation, cross-scene adaptation, and
cross-camera adaptation, respectively.

                                        <span>  Artifact-free super-resolution (SR) aims to translate low-resolution images
into their high-resolution counterparts with a strict integrity of the original
content, eliminating any distortions or synthetic details. While traditional
diffusion-based SR techniques have demonstrated remarkable abilities to enhance
image detail, they are prone to artifact introduction during iterative
procedures. Such artifacts, ranging from trivial noise to unauthentic textures,
deviate from the true structure of the source image, thus challenging the
integrity of the super-resolution process. In this work, we propose
Self-Adaptive Reality-Guided Diffusion (SARGD), a training-free method that
delves into the latent space to effectively identify and mitigate the
propagation of artifacts. Our SARGD begins by using an artifact detector to
identify implausible pixels, creating a binary mask that highlights artifacts.
Following this, the Reality Guidance Refinement (RGR) process refines artifacts
by integrating this mask with realistic latent representations, improving
alignment with the original image. Nonetheless, initial realistic-latent
representations from lower-quality images result in over-smoothing in the final
output. To address this, we introduce a Self-Adaptive Guidance (SAG) mechanism.
It dynamically computes a reality score, enhancing the sharpness of the
realistic latent. These alternating mechanisms collectively achieve
artifact-free super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method, delivering detailed artifact-free high-resolution
images while reducing sampling steps by 2X. We release our code at

                                        <span>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proved as a powerful framework
for denoising applications in medical imaging. However, GAN-based denoising
algorithms still suffer from limitations in capturing complex relationships
within the images. In this regard, the loss function plays a crucial role in
guiding the image generation process, encompassing how much a synthetic image
differs from a real image. To grasp highly complex and non-linear textural
relationships in the training process, this work presents a loss function that
leverages the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the Gray-Level-Co-occurrence
Matrix (GLCM). Although the recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated
superior performance in classification and detection tasks, we hypothesize that
its information content can be valuable when integrated into GANs' training. To
this end, we propose a differentiable implementation of the GLCM suited for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach also introduces a self-attention
layer that dynamically aggregates the multi-scale texture information extracted
from the images. We validate our approach by carrying out extensive experiments
in the context of low-dose CT denoising, a challenging application that aims to
enhance the quality of noisy CT scans. We utilize three publicly available
datasets, including one simulated and two real datasets. The results are
promising as compared to other well-established loss functions, being also
consistent across three different GAN architectures. The code is available at:

realistic artificial intelligence (AI)-generated videos. Malicious users can
easily create non-existent videos to spread false information. This letter
proposes an effective AI-generated video detection (AIGVDet) scheme by
capturing the forensic traces with a two-branch spatio-temporal convolutional
neural network (CNN). Specifically, two ResNet sub-detectors are learned
separately for identifying the anomalies in spatical and optical flow domains,
respectively. Results of such sub-detectors are fused to further enhance the
discrimination ability. A large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) is
constructed as a benchmark for model training and evaluation. Extensive
experimental results verify the high generalization and robustness of our
AIGVDet scheme. Code and dataset will be available at

                                        <span>  The objective of the collaborative vehicle-to-everything perception task is
to enhance the individual vehicle's perception capability through message
communication among neighboring traffic agents. Previous methods focus on
achieving optimal performance within bandwidth limitations and typically adopt
BEV maps as the basic collaborative message units. However, we demonstrate that
collaboration with dense representations is plagued by object feature
destruction during message packing, inefficient message aggregation for
long-range collaboration, and implicit structure representation communication.
To tackle these issues, we introduce a brand new message unit, namely point
cluster, designed to represent the scene sparsely with a combination of
low-level structure information and high-level semantic information. The point
cluster inherently preserves object information while packing messages, with
weak relevance to the collaboration range, and supports explicit structure
modeling. Building upon this representation, we propose a novel framework
V2X-PC for collaborative perception. This framework includes a Point Cluster
Packing (PCP) module to keep object feature and manage bandwidth through the
manipulation of cluster point numbers. As for effective message aggregation, we
propose a Point Cluster Aggregation (PCA) module to match and merge point
clusters associated with the same object. To further handle time latency and
pose errors encountered in real-world scenarios, we propose parameter-free
solutions that can adapt to different noisy levels without finetuning.
Experiments on two widely recognized collaborative perception benchmarks
showcase the superior performance of our method compared to the previous
state-of-the-art approaches relying on BEV maps.

of image generation. Despite their superior performance, diffusion models are
not without drawbacks; they are characterized by complex architectures and
substantial computational demands, resulting in significant latency due to
their iterative sampling process. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a
dual approach involving model miniaturization and a reduction in sampling
steps, aimed at significantly decreasing model latency. Our methodology
leverages knowledge distillation to streamline the U-Net and image decoder
architectures, and introduces an innovative one-step DM training technique that
utilizes feature matching and score distillation. We present two models,
SDXS-512 and SDXS-1024, achieving inference speeds of approximately 100 FPS
(30x faster than SD v1.5) and 30 FP (60x faster than SDXL) on a single GPU,
respectively. Moreover, our training approach offers promising applications in
image-conditioned control, facilitating efficient image-to-image translation.

heat and colds that occur due to climate change. Confidence in the predictions
should be reliable since a small increase in the temperatures in a year has a
big impact on the world. Calibration of the neural networks provides a way to
ensure our confidence in the predictions. However, calibrating regression
models is an under-researched topic, especially in forecasters. We calibrate a
UNet++ based architecture, which was shown to outperform physics-based models
in temperature anomalies. We show that with a slight trade-off between
prediction error and calibration error, it is possible to get more reliable and
sharper forecasts. We believe that calibration should be an important part of
safety-critical machine learning applications such as weather forecasters.

learning emerges as a pivotal paradigm. This work introduces Style Filter, a
tailored methodology for industrial contexts. By selectively filtering source
domain data before knowledge transfer, Style Filter reduces the quantity of
data while maintaining or even enhancing the performance of transfer learning
strategy. Offering label-free operation, minimal reliance on prior knowledge,
independence from specific models, and re-utilization, Style Filter is
evaluated on authentic industrial datasets, highlighting its effectiveness when
employed before conventional transfer strategies in the deep learning domain.
The results underscore the effectiveness of Style Filter in real-world
industrial applications.

                                        <span>  In recent years, semantic segmentation has become a pivotal tool in
processing and interpreting satellite imagery. Yet, a prevalent limitation of
supervised learning techniques remains the need for extensive manual
annotations by experts. In this work, we explore the potential of generative
image diffusion to address the scarcity of annotated data in earth observation
tasks. The main idea is to learn the joint data manifold of images and labels,
leveraging recent advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate both images and
corresponding masks for satellite segmentation. We find that the obtained pairs
not only display high quality in fine-scale features but also ensure a wide
sampling diversity. Both aspects are crucial for earth observation data, where
semantic classes can vary severely in scale and occurrence frequency. We employ
the novel data instances for downstream segmentation, as a form of data
augmentation. In our experiments, we provide comparisons to prior works based
on discriminative diffusion models or GANs. We demonstrate that integrating
generated samples yields significant quantitative improvements for satellite
semantic segmentation -- both compared to baselines and when training only on
the original data.

predictive performance and other critical factors, such as conveying
trustworthy predictive uncertainty. Uncertainty estimation (UE) methods provide
potential solutions for evaluating prediction reliability and improving the
model confidence calibration. Despite increasing interest in UE, challenges
persist, such as the need for explicit methods to capture aleatoric uncertainty
and align uncertainty estimates with real-life disagreements among domain
experts. This paper proposes an Expert Disagreement-Guided Uncertainty
Estimation (EDUE) for medical image segmentation. By leveraging variability in
ground-truth annotations from multiple raters, we guide the model during
training and incorporate random sampling-based strategies to enhance
calibration confidence. Our method achieves 55% and 23% improvement in
correlation on average with expert disagreements at the image and pixel levels,
respectively, better calibration, and competitive segmentation performance
compared to the state-of-the-art deep ensembles, requiring only a single
forward pass.

                                        <span>  Crop classification is of critical importance due to its role in studying
crop pattern changes, resource management, and carbon sequestration. When
employing data-driven techniques for its prediction, utilizing various temporal
data sources is necessary. Deep learning models have proven to be effective for
this task by mapping time series data to high-level representation for
prediction. However, they face substantial challenges when dealing with
multiple input patterns. The literature offers limited guidance for Multi-View
Learning (MVL) scenarios, as it has primarily focused on exploring fusion
strategies with specific encoders and validating them in local regions. In
contrast, we investigate the impact of simultaneous selection of the fusion
strategy and the encoder architecture evaluated on a global-scale cropland and
crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input,
Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoder architectures
(LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible MVL model configurations. The
validation is on the CropHarvest dataset that provides optical, radar, and
weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that
in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration
is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination,
including encoder and fusion strategy, should be meticulously sought. To
streamline this search process, we suggest initially identifying the optimal
encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then
determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We
provide a technical framework for researchers exploring crop classification or
related tasks through a MVL approach.

manner through in-context learning is an exciting advancement. Universal
segmentation models aim to generalize across the diverse modality of medical
images, yet their effectiveness often diminishes when applied to
out-of-distribution (OOD) data modalities and tasks, requiring intricate
fine-tuning of model for optimal performance. For addressing this challenge, we
introduce SegICL, a novel approach leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) for
image segmentation. Unlike existing methods, SegICL has the capability to
employ text-guided segmentation and conduct in-context learning with a small
set of image-mask pairs, eliminating the need for training the model from
scratch or fine-tuning for OOD tasks (including OOD modality and dataset).
Extensive experimental validation of SegICL demonstrates a positive correlation
between the number of prompt samples and segmentation performance on OOD
modalities and tasks. This indicates that SegICL effectively address new
segmentation tasks based on contextual information. Additionally, SegICL also
exhibits comparable segmentation performance to mainstream models on OOD and
in-distribution tasks. Our code will be released soon.

Nonetheless, these techniques could potentially generate misleading

adding visually unnoticeable artifacts into the input, while maintaining the

we leverage statistical analysis to highlight the changes in CNN weights within

avoiding the need for extra training. The method we suggest defences against
most modern explanation-aware adversarial attacks, achieving an approximate
decrease of ~99\% in the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a ~91\% reduction in the
Mean Square Error (MSE) between the original explanation and the defended

                                        <span>  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their ability to
perceive objects in still images, but their application in video-related tasks,
such as object tracking, remains understudied. This lack of exploration is
primarily due to two key challenges. Firstly, extensive pretraining on
large-scale video datasets is required to equip MLLMs with the capability to
perceive objects across multiple frames and understand inter-frame
relationships. Secondly, processing a large number of frames within the context
window of Large Language Models (LLMs) can impose a significant computational
burden. To address the first challenge, we introduce ElysiumTrack-1M, a
large-scale video dataset paired with novel tasks: Referring Single Object
Tracking (RSOT) and Video Referring Expression Generation (Video-REG).
ElysiumTrack-1M contains 1.27 million annotated video frames with corresponding
object boxes and descriptions. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct training of
MLLMs and propose a token-compression model T-Selector to tackle the second
challenge. Our proposed approach, Elysium: Exploring Object-level Perception in
Videos via MLLM, is an end-to-end trainable MLLM that makes the first attempt
to conduct object-level tasks in videos without requiring any additional
plug-in or expert models.

                                        <span>  Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with
Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their
potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models
in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several
innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K
attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance
of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity.
ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the
performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking
transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a
versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut
specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a
hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training.
QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing
state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with
comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a
groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially
outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first
time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The

cloud scene referred to by a natural language description. While previous works
attempt to exploit the verbo-visual relation with proposed cross-modal
transformers, unstructured natural utterances and scattered objects might lead
to undesirable performances. In this paper, we introduce DOrA, a novel 3D
visual grounding framework with Order-Aware referring. DOrA is designed to
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse language description, suggesting
a referential order of anchor objects. Such ordered anchor objects allow DOrA
to update visual features and locate the target object during the grounding
process. Experimental results on the NR3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate
our superiority in both low-resource and full-data scenarios. In particular,
DOrA surpasses current state-of-the-art frameworks by 9.3% and 7.8% grounding
accuracy under 1% data and 10% data settings, respectively.

unparalleled results in predicting temporal and spatial dynamics. However,
modeling extensive global information remains a formidable challenge; CNNs are
limited by their narrow receptive fields, and ViTs struggle with the intensive
computational demands of their attention mechanisms. The emergence of recent
Mamba-based architectures has been met with enthusiasm for their exceptional
long-sequence modeling capabilities, surpassing established vision models in
efficiency and accuracy, which motivates us to develop an innovative
architecture tailored for spatiotemporal forecasting. In this paper, we propose
the VMRNN cell, a new recurrent unit that integrates the strengths of Vision
Mamba blocks with LSTM. We construct a network centered on VMRNN cells to
tackle spatiotemporal prediction tasks effectively. Our extensive evaluations
show that our proposed approach secures competitive results on a variety of
tasks while maintaining a smaller model size. Our code is available at

generation tasks such as text-to-image and text-to-video. However,
state-of-the-art models still fail to align the generated visual concepts with
high-level semantics in a language such as object count, spatial relationship,
etc. We approach this problem from a multimodal data fusion perspective and
investigate how different fusion strategies can affect vision-language
alignment. We discover that compared to the widely used early fusion of
conditioning text in a pretrained image feature space, a specially designed
intermediate fusion can: (i) boost text-to-image alignment with improved
generation quality and (ii) improve training and inference efficiency by
reducing low-rank text-to-image attention calculations. We perform experiments
using a text-to-image generation task on the MS-COCO dataset. We compare our
intermediate fusion mechanism with the classic early fusion mechanism on two
common conditioning methods on a U-shaped ViT backbone. Our intermediate fusion
model achieves a higher CLIP Score and lower FID, with 20% reduced FLOPs, and
50% increased training speed compared to a strong U-ViT baseline with an early
fusion.

internet-scale datasets? We answer this question with a clear no - VLMs
introduce closed-set assumptions via their finite query set, making them
vulnerable to open-set conditions. We systematically evaluate VLMs for open-set
recognition and find they frequently misclassify objects not contained in their
query set, leading to alarmingly low precision when tuned for high recall and
vice versa. We show that naively increasing the size of the query set to
contain more and more classes does not mitigate this problem, but instead
causes diminishing task performance and open-set performance. We establish a
revised definition of the open-set problem for the age of VLMs, define a new
benchmark and evaluation protocol to facilitate standardised evaluation and
research in this important area, and evaluate promising baseline approaches
based on predictive uncertainty and dedicated negative embeddings on a range of
VLM classifiers and object detectors.

                                        <span>  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative condition leading
to cognitive and functional deterioration. Given the lack of a cure, prompt and
precise AD diagnosis is vital, a complex process dependent on multiple factors
and multi-modal data. While successful efforts have been made to integrate
multi-modal representation learning into medical datasets, scant attention has
been given to 3D medical images. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Masked
Vim Autoencoder (CMViM), the first efficient representation learning method
tailored for 3D multi-modal data. Our proposed framework is built on a masked
Vim autoencoder to learn a unified multi-modal representation and
long-dependencies contained in 3D medical images. We also introduce an
intra-modal contrastive learning module to enhance the capability of the
multi-modal Vim encoder for modeling the discriminative features in the same
modality, and an inter-modal contrastive learning module to alleviate
misaligned representation among modalities. Our framework consists of two main
steps: 1) incorporate the Vision Mamba (Vim) into the mask autoencoder to
reconstruct 3D masked multi-modal data efficiently. 2) align the multi-modal
representations with contrastive learning mechanisms from both intra-modal and
inter-modal aspects. Our framework is pre-trained and validated ADNI2 dataset
and validated on the downstream task for AD classification. The proposed CMViM
yields 2.7\% AUC performance improvement compared with other state-of-the-art
methods.

visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain
abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g.,
locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided
generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the
model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to
generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the
limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme,
facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can
function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document
images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU
tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance
over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information
extraction, document classification, and document question answering.

                                        <span>  In the last few years, generative models have shown their powerful
capabilities in synthesizing realistic images in both quality and diversity
(i.e., facial images, and natural subjects). Unfortunately, the artifact
patterns in fake images synthesized by different generative models are
inconsistent, leading to the failure of previous research that relied on
spotting subtle differences between real and fake. In our preliminary
experiments, we find that the artifacts in fake images always change with the
development of the generative model, while natural images exhibit stable
statistical properties. In this paper, we employ natural traces shared only by
real images as an additional predictive target in the detector. Specifically,
the natural traces are learned from the wild real images and we introduce
extended supervised contrastive learning to bring them closer to real images
and further away from fake ones. This motivates the detector to make decisions
based on the proximity of images to the natural traces. To conduct a
comprehensive experiment, we built a high-quality and diverse dataset that
includes generative models comprising 6 GAN and 6 diffusion models, to evaluate
the effectiveness in generalizing unknown forgery techniques and robustness in
surviving different transformations. Experimental results show that our
proposed method gives 96.1% mAP significantly outperforms the baselines.
Extensive experiments conducted on the widely recognized platform Midjourney
reveal that our proposed method achieves an accuracy exceeding 78.4%,
underscoring its practicality for real-world application deployment. The source
code and partial self-built dataset are available in supplementary material.

solutions, directly generating anchor-style videos with full-body motions
remains challenging. In this study, we propose Make-Your-Anchor, a novel system
necessitating only a one-minute video clip of an individual for training,
subsequently enabling the automatic generation of anchor-style videos with
precise torso and hand movements. Specifically, we finetune a proposed
structure-guided diffusion model on input video to render 3D mesh conditions
into human appearances. We adopt a two-stage training strategy for the
diffusion model, effectively binding movements with specific appearances. To
produce arbitrary long temporal video, we extend the 2D U-Net in the frame-wise
diffusion model to a 3D style without additional training cost, and a simple
yet effective batch-overlapped temporal denoising module is proposed to bypass
the constraints on video length during inference. Finally, a novel
identity-specific face enhancement module is introduced to improve the visual
quality of facial regions in the output videos. Comparative experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the system in terms of visual
quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation, outperforming SOTA
diffusion/non-diffusion methods. Project page:

                                        <span>  Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pretraining deep
networks on unlabeled data, prior to transfer learning of target tasks with
limited annotation. The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target
tasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks
have been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three
dimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic
ones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data
with anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of
the imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can
pretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work,
we propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data
based on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn
the relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as
regressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging
planes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack. Both pretext
tasks are conceptually straightforward and easy to implement, and can be
combined in multitask learning for better representation learning. Thorough
experiments on two anatomical structures (heart and knee) and representative
target tasks (semantic segmentation and classification) demonstrate that the
proposed pretext tasks are effective in pretraining deep networks for
remarkably boosted performance on the target tasks, and superior to other
recent approaches.

                                        <span>  As natural image understanding moves towards the pretrain-finetune era,
research in pathology imaging is concurrently evolving. Despite the predominant
focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation
models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we
propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the
Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework
designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to
pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework
leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to
identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts
for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple
datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance
over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune
facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to
pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models
with simple linear probing. The code will be available upon acceptance.

                                        <span>  We present CT-Bound, a fast boundary estimation method for noisy images using
a hybrid Convolution and Transformer neural network. The proposed architecture
decomposes boundary estimation into two tasks: local detection and global
regularization of image boundaries. It first estimates a parametric
representation of boundary structures only using the input image within a small
receptive field and then refines the boundary structure in the parameter domain
without accessing the input image. Because of this, a part of the network can
be easily trained using naive, synthetic images and still generalized to real
images, and the entire architecture is computationally efficient as the
boundary refinement is non-iterative and not in the image domain. Compared with
the previous highest accuracy methods, our experiment shows that CT-Bound is
100 times faster, producing comparably accurate, high-quality boundary and
color maps. We also demonstrate that CT-Bound can produce boundary and color
maps on real captured images without extra fine-tuning and real-time boundary
map and color map videos at ten frames per second.

synthesis on various scenes, including highly reflective objects and unbounded
outdoor scenes. Existing real-time rendering methods, especially those based on
meshes, often have subpar performance in modeling surfaces with rich
view-dependent appearances. Our key idea lies in leveraging meshes for
rendering acceleration while incorporating a novel approach to parameterize
view-dependent information. We decompose the color into diffuse and specular,
and model the specular color in the reflected direction based on a neural
environment map. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable reconstruction quality for highly reflective surfaces compared to
state-of-the-art offline methods, while also efficiently enabling real-time
rendering on edge devices such as smartphones.

                                        <span>  Unsupervised person re-identification aims to retrieve images of a specified
person without identity labels. Many recent unsupervised Re-ID approaches adopt
clustering-based methods to measure cross-camera feature similarity to roughly
divide images into clusters. They ignore the feature distribution discrepancy
induced by camera domain gap, resulting in the unavoidable performance
degradation. Camera information is usually available, and the feature
distribution in the single camera usually focuses more on the appearance of the
individual and has less intra-identity variance. Inspired by the observation,
we introduce a \textbf{C}amera-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{L}abel
\textbf{R}efinement~(CALR) framework that reduces camera discrepancy by
clustering intra-camera similarity. Specifically, we employ intra-camera
training to obtain reliable local pseudo labels within each camera, and then
refine global labels generated by inter-camera clustering and train the
discriminative model using more reliable global pseudo labels in a self-paced
manner. Meanwhile, we develop a camera-alignment module to align feature
distributions under different cameras, which could help deal with the camera
variance further. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our
proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches. The code is accessible at
https://github.com/leeBooMla/CALR.

extent VLMs prioritize this information to represent concepts. We propose
Extract and Explore (EX2), a novel approach to characterize important textual
features for VLMs. EX2 uses reinforcement learning to align a large language
model with VLM preferences and generates descriptions that incorporate the
important features for the VLM. Then, we inspect the descriptions to identify
the features that contribute to VLM representations. We find that spurious
descriptions have a major role in VLM representations despite providing no
helpful information, e.g., Click to enlarge photo of CONCEPT. More importantly,
among informative descriptions, VLMs rely significantly on non-visual
attributes like habitat to represent visual concepts. Also, our analysis
reveals that different VLMs prioritize different attributes in their
representations. Overall, we show that VLMs do not simply match images to scene
descriptions and that non-visual or even spurious descriptions significantly
influence their representations.

                                        <span>  Three-dimensional object detection is one of the key tasks in autonomous
driving. To reduce costs in practice, low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object
detection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However, relying
solely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object
detection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras
with the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable
multi-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a
radar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV).
Specifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction.
RadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section
(RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based
encoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features,
with an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the
two encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to
scattering the point feature in BEV. Besides, we present the Cross-Attention
Multi-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature
from radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism, and then fuse
the feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show
that RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on
nuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks. Furthermore,
RCBEVDet achieves better 3D detection results than all real-time camera-only
and radar-camera 3D object detectors with a faster inference speed at 21~28
FPS. The source code will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/RCBEVDet.

                                        <span>  High-definition (HD) maps have played an integral role in the development of
modern autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks, albeit with high associated labeling and
maintenance costs. As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for
estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of
previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches
are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their
integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or
confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online
map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this
enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In
doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster
training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the
real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

                                        <span>  In voltage imaging, where the membrane potentials of individual neurons are
recorded at from hundreds to thousand frames per second using fluorescence
microscopy, data processing presents a challenge. Even a fraction of a minute
of recording with a limited image size yields gigabytes of video data
consisting of tens of thousands of frames, which can be time-consuming to
process. Moreover, millisecond-level short exposures lead to noisy video
frames, obscuring neuron footprints especially in deep-brain samples where
noisy signals are buried in background fluorescence. To address this challenge,
we propose a fast neuron segmentation method able to detect multiple,
potentially overlapping, spiking neurons from noisy video frames, and implement
a data processing pipeline incorporating the proposed segmentation method along
with GPU-accelerated motion correction. By testing on existing datasets as well
as on new datasets we introduce, we show that our pipeline extracts neuron
footprints that agree well with human annotation even from cluttered datasets,
and demonstrate real-time processing of voltage imaging data on a single
desktop computer for the first time.

                                        <span>  Point scene understanding is a challenging task to process real-world scene
point cloud, which aims at segmenting each object, estimating its pose, and
reconstructing its mesh simultaneously. Recent state-of-the-art method first
segments each object and then processes them independently with multiple stages
for the different sub-tasks. This leads to a complex pipeline to optimize and
makes it hard to leverage the relationship constraints between multiple
objects. In this work, we propose a novel Disentangled Object-Centric
TRansformer (DOCTR) that explores object-centric representation to facilitate
learning with multiple objects for the multiple sub-tasks in a unified manner.
Each object is represented as a query, and a Transformer decoder is adapted to
iteratively optimize all the queries involving their relationship. In
particular, we introduce a semantic-geometry disentangled query (SGDQ) design
that enables the query features to attend separately to semantic information
and geometric information relevant to the corresponding sub-tasks. A hybrid
bipartite matching module is employed to well use the supervisions from all the
sub-tasks during training. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
challenging ScanNet dataset. Code is available at

egocentric views is important for tasks in robotics, AR/VR, action recognition
and motion generation. Accurately reconstructing such interactions in 3D is
challenging due to heavy occlusion, viewpoint bias, camera distortion, and
motion blur from the head movement. To this end, we designed the HANDS23
challenge based on the AssemblyHands and ARCTIC datasets with carefully
designed training and testing splits. Based on the results of the top submitted
methods and more recent baselines on the leaderboards, we perform a thorough
analysis on 3D hand(-object) reconstruction tasks. Our analysis demonstrates
the effectiveness of addressing distortion specific to egocentric cameras,
adopting high-capacity transformers to learn complex hand-object interactions,
and fusing predictions from different views. Our study further reveals
challenging scenarios intractable with state-of-the-art methods, such as fast
hand motion, object reconstruction from narrow egocentric views, and close
contact between two hands and objects. Our efforts will enrich the community's

                                        <span>  Event cameras are increasingly popular in robotics due to their beneficial
features, such as low latency, energy efficiency, and high dynamic range.
Nevertheless, their downstream task performance is greatly influenced by the
optimization of bias parameters. These parameters, for instance, regulate the
necessary change in light intensity to trigger an event, which in turn depends
on factors such as the environment lighting and camera motion. This paper
introduces feedback control algorithms that automatically tune the bias
parameters through two interacting methods: 1) An immediate, on-the-fly fast
adaptation of the refractory period, which sets the minimum interval between
consecutive events, and 2) if the event rate exceeds the specified bounds even
after changing the refractory period repeatedly, the controller adapts the
pixel bandwidth and event thresholds, which stabilizes after a short period of
noise events across all pixels (slow adaptation). Our evaluation focuses on the
visual place recognition task, where incoming query images are compared to a
given reference database. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our
algorithms' adaptive feedback control in real-time. To do so, we collected the
QCR-Fast-and-Slow dataset that contains DAVIS346 event camera streams from 366
repeated traversals of a Scout Mini robot navigating through a 100 meter long
indoor lab setting (totaling over 35km distance traveled) in varying brightness
conditions with ground truth location information. Our proposed feedback
controllers result in superior performance when compared to the standard bias
settings and prior feedback control methods. Our findings also detail the
impact of bias adjustments on task performance and feature ablation studies on
the fast and slow adaptation mechanisms.

diffusion models have gained significant attention. However, vanilla diffusion
models often suffer from spelling inaccuracies in the text displayed within the
generated images. The capability to generate visual text is crucial, offering
both academic interest and a wide range of practical applications. To produce
accurate visual text images, state-of-the-art techniques adopt a
glyph-controlled image generation approach, consisting of a text layout
generator followed by an image generator that is conditioned on the generated
text layout. Nevertheless, our study reveals that these models still face three
primary challenges, prompting us to develop a testbed to facilitate future
research. We introduce a benchmark, LenCom-Eval, specifically designed for
testing models' capability in generating images with Lengthy and Complex visual
text. Subsequently, we introduce a training-free framework to enhance the
two-stage generation approaches. We examine the effectiveness of our approach
on both LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval benchmarks and demonstrate notable
improvements across a range of evaluation metrics, including CLIPScore, OCR
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and edit distance scores. For instance,
our proposed framework improves the backbone model, TextDiffuser, by more than
23\% and 13.5\% in terms of OCR word F1 on LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval,
respectively. Our work makes a unique contribution to the field by focusing on
generating images with long and rare text sequences, a niche previously
unexplored by existing literature

correspondences between source and target point clouds. Existing methods obtain
correspondences directly by computing point-wise feature similarity between
point clouds. However, non-rigid objects possess strong deformability and
unusual shapes, making it a longstanding challenge to directly establish
correspondences between point clouds with unconventional shapes. To address
this challenge, we propose an unsupervised Template-Assisted point cloud shape
correspondence Network, termed TANet, including a template generation module
and a template assistance module. The proposed TANet enjoys several merits.
Firstly, the template generation module establishes a set of learnable
templates with explicit structures. Secondly, we introduce a template
assistance module that extensively leverages the generated templates to
establish more accurate shape correspondences from multiple perspectives.
Extensive experiments on four human and animal datasets demonstrate that TANet
achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  As a neuromorphic sensor with high temporal resolution, spike cameras offer
notable advantages over traditional cameras in high-speed vision applications
such as high-speed optical estimation, depth estimation, and object tracking.
Inspired by the success of the spike camera, we proposed Spike-NeRF, the first
Neural Radiance Field derived from spike data, to achieve 3D reconstruction and
novel viewpoint synthesis of high-speed scenes. Instead of the multi-view
images at the same time of NeRF, the inputs of Spike-NeRF are continuous spike
streams captured by a moving spike camera in a very short time. To reconstruct
a correct and stable 3D scene from high-frequency but unstable spike data, we
devised spike masks along with a distinctive loss function. We evaluate our
method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic scenes
generated by blender with the spike camera simulator. Our results demonstrate
that Spike-NeRF produces more visually appealing results than the existing
methods and the baseline we proposed in high-speed scenes. Our code and data
will be released soon.

attention due to its broad range of applications. One critical aspect of this
field is the generation of long-duration videos, which presents unique
challenges and opportunities. This paper presents the first survey of recent
advancements in long video generation and summarises them into two key
paradigms: divide and conquer temporal autoregressive.
  We delve into the common models employed in each paradigm, including aspects
of network design and conditioning techniques. Furthermore, we offer a
comprehensive overview and classification of the datasets and evaluation
metrics which are crucial for advancing long video generation research.
Concluding with a summary of existing studies, we also discuss the emerging
challenges and future directions in this dynamic field. We hope that this
survey will serve as an essential reference for researchers and practitioners
in the realm of long video generation.

                                        <span>  The integration of an ensemble of deep learning models has been extensively
explored to enhance defense against adversarial attacks. The diversity among
sub-models increases the attack cost required to deceive the majority of the
ensemble, thereby improving the adversarial robustness. While existing
approaches mainly center on increasing diversity in feature representations or
dispersion of first-order gradients with respect to input, the limited
correlation between these diversity metrics and adversarial robustness
constrains the performance of ensemble adversarial defense. In this work, we
aim to enhance ensemble diversity by reducing attack transferability. We
identify second-order gradients, which depict the loss curvature, as a key
factor in adversarial robustness. Computing the Hessian matrix involved in
second-order gradients is computationally expensive. To address this, we
approximate the Hessian-vector product using differential approximation. Given
that low curvature provides better robustness, our ensemble model was designed
to consider the influence of curvature among different sub-models. We introduce
a novel regularizer to train multiple more-diverse low-curvature network
models. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that our
ensemble model exhibits superior robustness against a range of attacks,
underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

                                        <span>  In medical and industrial domains, providing guidance for assembly processes
is critical to ensure efficiency and safety. Errors in assembly can lead to
significant consequences such as extended surgery times, and prolonged
manufacturing or maintenance times in industry. Assembly scenarios can benefit
from in-situ AR visualization to provide guidance, reduce assembly times and
minimize errors. To enable in-situ visualization 6D pose estimation can be
leveraged. Existing 6D pose estimation techniques primarily focus on individual
objects and static captures. However, assembly scenarios have various dynamics
including occlusion during assembly and dynamics in the assembly objects
appearance. Existing work, combining object detection/6D pose estimation and
assembly state detection focuses either on pure deep learning-based approaches,
or limit the assembly state detection to building blocks. To address the
challenges of 6D pose estimation in combination with assembly state detection,
our approach ASDF builds upon the strengths of YOLOv8, a real-time capable
object detection framework. We extend this framework, refine the object pose
and fuse pose knowledge with network-detected pose information. Utilizing our
late fusion in our Pose2State module results in refined 6D pose estimation and
assembly state detection. By combining both pose and state information, our
Pose2State module predicts the final assembly state with precision. Our
evaluation on our ASDF dataset shows that our Pose2State module leads to an
improved assembly state detection and that the improvement of the assembly
state further leads to a more robust 6D pose estimation. Moreover, on the GBOT
dataset, we outperform the pure deep learning-based network, and even
outperform the hybrid and pure tracking-based approaches.

success in several modern deep trackers. However, there is an inherent
difference between classification and regression tasks, so they have diverse
even opposite demands for feature matching. Existed models always ignore the
key issue and only employ a unified matching block in two task branches,
decaying the decision quality. Besides, these models also struggle with
decision misalignment situation. In this paper, we propose a multi-attention
associate prediction network (MAPNet) to tackle the above problems. Concretely,
two novel matchers, i.e., category-aware matcher and spatial-aware matcher, are
first designed for feature comparison by integrating self, cross, channel or
spatial attentions organically. They are capable of fully capturing the
category-related semantics for classification and the local spatial contexts
for regression, respectively. Then, we present a dual alignment module to
enhance the correspondences between two branches, which is useful to find the
optimal tracking solution. Finally, we describe a Siamese tracker built upon
the proposed prediction network, which achieves the leading performance on five
tracking benchmarks, consisting of LaSOT, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2k and
UAV123, and surpasses other state-of-the-art approaches.

typically helpless in dealing with degradations in low-quality source images
and non-interactive to multiple subjective and objective needs. To solve them,
we introduce a novel approach that leverages semantic text guidance image
fusion model for degradation-aware and interactive image fusion task, termed as
Text-IF. It innovatively extends the classical image fusion to the text guided
image fusion along with the ability to harmoniously address the degradation and
interaction issues during fusion. Through the text semantic encoder and
semantic interaction fusion decoder, Text-IF is accessible to the all-in-one
infrared and visible image degradation-aware processing and the interactive
flexible fusion outcomes. In this way, Text-IF achieves not only multi-modal
image fusion, but also multi-modal information fusion. Extensive experiments
prove that our proposed text guided image fusion strategy has obvious
advantages over SOTA methods in the image fusion performance and degradation

                                        <span>  Medical report generation has achieved remarkable advancements yet has still
been faced with several challenges. First, the inherent imbalance in the
distribution of normal and abnormal cases may lead models to exhibit a biased
focus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses. Second, the
frequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm
the critical abnormal information. Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest
X-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional
nature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs. Recently,
LLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate
prompts, which shed light on addressing the aforementioned challenges. In this
paper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report
generation by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts.
Considering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with
perceiver to extract the visual information. To tailor the LLM for report
generation and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic
information by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated
during training to capture common disease representations. Furthermore, we
introduce disease-aware attention to enable the model to adjust attention for
different diseases. Experiments on the chest CT dataset demonstrated that our
proposed method outperformed previous methods and achieved state-of-the-art on
both clinical efficacy performance and natural language generation metrics. The
code will be made publically available.

                                        <span>  Understanding data visualizations like charts and plots requires reasoning
about both visual elements and numerics. Although strong in extractive
questions, current chart visual question answering (chart VQA) models suffer on
complex reasoning questions. In this work, we address the lack of reasoning
ability by data augmentation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), which
have shown to have strong reasoning ability, as an automatic data annotator
that generates question-answer annotations for chart images. The key innovation
in our method lies in the Synthesize Step-by-Step strategy: our LLM-based data
generator learns to decompose the complex question into step-by-step
sub-questions (rationales), which are then used to derive the final answer
using external tools, i.e. Python. This step-wise generation procedure is
trained on synthetic data generated using a template-based QA generation
pipeline. Experimental results highlight the significance of the proposed
step-by-step generation. By training with the LLM-augmented data (LAMENDA), we
significantly enhance the chart VQA models, achieving the state-of-the-art
accuracy on the ChartQA and PlotQA datasets. In particular, our approach
improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art approach from 38% to 54%
on the human-written questions in the ChartQA dataset, which needs strong
reasoning. We hope our work underscores the potential of synthetic data and
encourages further exploration of data augmentation using LLMs for
reasoning-heavy tasks.

                                        <span>  Ultrasound imaging is crucial for evaluating organ morphology and function,
yet depth adjustment can degrade image quality and field-of-view, presenting a
depth-dependent dilemma. Traditional interpolation-based zoom-in techniques
often sacrifice detail and introduce artifacts. Motivated by the potential of
arbitrary-scale super-resolution to naturally address these inherent
challenges, we present the Residual Dense Swin Transformer Network (RDSTN),
designed to capture the non-local characteristics and long-range dependencies
intrinsic to ultrasound images. It comprises a linear embedding module for
feature enhancement, an encoder with shifted-window attention for modeling
non-locality, and an MLP decoder for continuous detail reconstruction. This
strategy streamlines balancing image quality and field-of-view, which offers
superior textures over traditional methods. Experimentally, RDSTN outperforms
existing approaches while requiring fewer parameters. In conclusion, RDSTN
shows promising potential for ultrasound image enhancement by overcoming the
limitations of conventional interpolation-based methods and achieving
depth-independent imaging.

                                        <span>  In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
text-to-image generative models. Evaluating the quality of the generative
models is one essential step in the development process. Unfortunately, the
evaluation process could consume a significant amount of computational
resources, making the required periodic evaluation of model performance (e.g.,
monitoring training progress) impractical. Therefore, we seek to improve the
evaluation efficiency by selecting the representative subset of the text-image
dataset. We systematically investigate the design choices, including the
selection criteria (textural features or image-based metrics) and the selection
granularity (prompt-level or set-level). We find that the insights from prior
work on subset selection for training data do not generalize to this problem,
and we propose FlashEval, an iterative search algorithm tailored to evaluation
data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashEval on ranking
diffusion models with various configurations, including architectures,
quantization levels, and sampler schedules on COCO and DiffusionDB datasets.
Our searched 50-item subset could achieve comparable evaluation quality to the
randomly sampled 500-item subset for COCO annotations on unseen models,
achieving a 10x evaluation speedup. We release the condensed subset of these
commonly used datasets to help facilitate diffusion algorithm design and
evaluation, and open-source FlashEval as a tool for condensing future datasets,

                                        <span>  360 depth estimation has recently received great attention for 3D
reconstruction owing to its omnidirectional field of view (FoV). Recent
approaches are predominantly focused on cross-projection fusion with
geometry-based re-projection: they fuse 360 images with equirectangular
projection (ERP) and another projection type, e.g., cubemap projection to
estimate depth with the ERP format. However, these methods suffer from 1)
limited local receptive fields, making it hardly possible to capture large FoV
scenes, and 2) prohibitive computational cost, caused by the complex
cross-projection fusion module design. In this paper, we propose Elite360D, a
novel framework that inputs the ERP image and icosahedron projection (ICOSAP)
point set, which is undistorted and spatially continuous. Elite360D is superior
in its capacity in learning a representation from a local-with-global
perspective. With a flexible ERP image encoder, it includes an ICOSAP point
encoder, and a Bi-projection Bi-attention Fusion (B2F) module (totally ~1M
parameters). Specifically, the ERP image encoder can take various perspective
image-trained backbones (e.g., ResNet, Transformer) to extract local features.
The point encoder extracts the global features from the ICOSAP. Then, the B2F
module captures the semantic- and distance-aware dependencies between each
pixel of the ERP feature and the entire ICOSAP feature set. Without specific
backbone design and obvious computational cost increase, Elite360D outperforms
the prior arts on several benchmark datasets.

zero-shot instance segmentation capacity -- to learn a compact panoramic
semantic segmentation model, i.e., student, without requiring any labeled data.
This poses considerable challenges due to SAM's inability to provide semantic
labels and the large capacity gap between SAM and the student. To this end, we
propose a novel framework, called GoodSAM, that introduces a teacher assistant
(TA) to provide semantic information, integrated with SAM to generate ensemble
logits to achieve knowledge transfer. Specifically, we propose a
Distortion-Aware Rectification (DAR) module that first addresses the distortion
problem of panoramic images by imposing prediction-level consistency and
boundary enhancement. This subtly enhances TA's prediction capacity on
panoramic images. DAR then incorporates a cross-task complementary fusion block
to adaptively merge the predictions of SAM and TA to obtain more reliable
ensemble logits. Moreover, we introduce a Multi-level Knowledge Adaptation
(MKA) module to efficiently transfer the multi-level feature knowledge from TA
and ensemble logits to learn a compact student model. Extensive experiments on
two benchmarks show that our GoodSAM achieves a remarkable +3.75\% mIoU
improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods. Also,
our most lightweight model achieves comparable performance to the SOTA methods
with only 3.7M parameters.

                                        <span>  In image restoration (IR), leveraging semantic priors from segmentation
models has been a common approach to improve performance. The recent segment
anything model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting advanced
semantic priors to enhance IR tasks. However, the computational cost of SAM is
prohibitive for IR, compared to existing smaller IR models. The incorporation
of SAM for extracting semantic priors considerably hampers the model inference
efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a general framework to distill
SAM's semantic knowledge to boost exiting IR models without interfering with
their inference process. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of the
semantic priors fusion (SPF) scheme and the semantic priors distillation (SPD)
scheme. SPF fuses two kinds of information between the restored image predicted
by the original IR model and the semantic mask predicted by SAM for the refined
restored image. SPD leverages a self-distillation manner to distill the fused
semantic priors to boost the performance of original IR models. Additionally,
we design a semantic-guided relation (SGR) module for SPD, which ensures
semantic feature representation space consistency to fully distill the priors.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across multiple IR models and
tasks, including deraining, deblurring, and denoising.

scraped with minimal human inspection. As a result of this insecure curation
pipeline, an adversary can poison or backdoor the resulting model by uploading
malicious data to the internet and waiting for a victim to scrape and train on
it. Existing approaches for creating poisons and backdoors start with randomly
sampled clean data, called base samples, and then modify those samples to craft
poisons. However, some base samples may be significantly more amenable to
poisoning than others. As a result, we may be able to craft more potent poisons
by carefully choosing the base samples. In this work, we use guided diffusion
to synthesize base samples from scratch that lead to significantly more potent
poisons and backdoors than previous state-of-the-art attacks. Our Guided
Diffusion Poisoning (GDP) base samples can be combined with any downstream
poisoning or backdoor attack to boost its effectiveness. Our implementation

respiration-resolved images and can be used for image-guided radiation therapy.
However, the ability to reveal respiratory motion comes at the cost of image
artifacts. As raw projection data are sorted into multiple respiratory phases,
there is a limited number of cone-beam projections available for image
reconstruction. Consequently, the 4D CBCT images are covered by severe streak
artifacts. Although several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to
address this issue, most algorithms employ ordinary network models, neglecting
the intrinsic structural prior within 4D CBCT images. In this paper, we first
explore the origin and appearance of streak artifacts in 4D CBCT
images.Specifically, we find that streak artifacts exhibit a periodic
rotational motion along with the patient's respiration. This unique motion
pattern inspires us to distinguish the artifacts from the desired anatomical
structures in the spatiotemporal domain. Thereafter, we propose a
spatiotemporal neural network named RSTAR-Net with separable and circular
convolutions for Rotational Streak Artifact Reduction. The specially designed
model effectively encodes dynamic image features, facilitating the recovery of
4D CBCT images. Moreover, RSTAR-Net is also lightweight and computationally
efficient. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method, and RSTAR-Net shows superior performance to comparison methods.

representations, especially graph Transformer, which has recently shown
superior performance on various graph mining tasks. However, graph Transformer
generally treats nodes as tokens, which results in quadratic complexity
regarding the number of nodes during self-attention computation. The graph MLP
Mixer addresses this challenge by using the efficient MLP Mixer technique from
computer vision. However, the time-consuming process of extracting graph tokens
limits its performance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture named
ChebMixer, a newly graph MLP Mixer that uses fast Chebyshev polynomials-based
spectral filtering to extract a sequence of tokens. Firstly, we produce
multiscale representations of graph nodes via fast Chebyshev polynomial-based
spectral filtering. Next, we consider each node's multiscale representations as
a sequence of tokens and refine the node representation with an effective MLP
Mixer. Finally, we aggregate the multiscale representations of nodes through
Chebyshev interpolation. Owing to the powerful representation capabilities and
fast computational properties of MLP Mixer, we can quickly extract more
informative node representations to improve the performance of downstream
tasks. The experimental results prove our significant improvements in a variety
of scenarios ranging from graph node classification to medical image

                                        <span>  Medical image segmentation (MIS) aims to finely segment various organs. It
requires grasping global information from both parts and the entire image for
better segmenting, and clinically there are often certain requirements for
segmentation efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made
considerable achievements in MIS. However, they are difficult to fully collect
global context information and their pooling layer may cause information loss.
Capsule networks, which combine the benefits of CNNs while taking into account
additional information such as relative location that CNNs do not, have lately
demonstrated some advantages in MIS. Vision Transformer (ViT) employs
transformers in visual tasks. Transformer based on attention mechanism has
excellent global inductive modeling capabilities and is expected to capture
longrange information. Moreover, there have been resent studies on making ViT
more lightweight to minimize model complexity and increase efficiency. In this
paper, we propose a U-shaped 3D encoder-decoder network named 3D-EffiViTCaps,
which combines 3D capsule blocks with 3D EfficientViT blocks for MIS. Our
encoder uses capsule blocks and EfficientViT blocks to jointly capture local
and global semantic information more effectively and efficiently with less
information loss, while the decoder employs CNN blocks and EfficientViT blocks
to catch ffner details for segmentation. We conduct experiments on various
datasets, including iSeg-2017, Hippocampus and Cardiac to verify the
performance and efficiency of 3D-EffiViTCaps, which performs better than
previous 3D CNN-based, 3D Capsule-based and 3D Transformer-based models. We
further implement a series of ablation experiments on the main blocks. Our code

the diverse scenarios needed for building a robust and safe system. The data
volumes are in the order of Exabytes and have to be stored for a long period of
time (i.e., more than 10 years of the vehicle's life cycle). Lossless
compression doesn't provide sufficient compression ratios, hence, lossy video
compression has been explored. It is essential to prove that lossy video
compression artifacts do not impact the performance of the perception
algorithms. However, there is limited work in this area to provide a solid
conclusion. In particular, there is no such work for fisheye cameras, which
have high radial distortion and where compression may have higher artifacts.
Fisheye cameras are commonly used in automotive systems for 3D object detection
task. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of standard
video compression codecs on wide FOV fisheye camera images. We demonstrate that
the achievable compression with negligible impact depends on the dataset and
temporal prediction of the video codec. We propose a radial distortion-aware
zonal metric to evaluate the performance of artifacts in fisheye images. In
addition, we present a novel method for estimating affine mode parameters of
the latest VVC codec, and suggest some areas for improvement in video codecs
for the application to fisheye imagery.

                                        <span>  The effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) heavily relies on the
abundance and accuracy of available training data. However, collecting and
annotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive,
particularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with
their duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various
scenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when
dealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different
devices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,
we introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion
(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new
informative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based
on natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant
GPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method
tailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective
fine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\% of parameters
compared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset
diversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process
prompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across
different images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making
processes regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial
role than intensity. In conclusion, our pipeline not only outperforms
classifiers trained on the original dataset but also demonstrates superior
performance when encountering unseen datasets. The source code is available at

                                        <span>  In the realm of fashion design, sketches serve as the canvas for expressing
an artist's distinctive drawing style and creative vision, capturing intricate
details like stroke variations and texture nuances. The advent of
sketch-to-image cross-modal translation technology has notably aided designers.
However, existing methods often compromise these sketch details during image
generation, resulting in images that deviate from the designer's intended
concept. This limitation hampers the ability to offer designers a precise
preview of the final output. To overcome this challenge, we introduce HAIFIT, a
novel approach that transforms sketches into high-fidelity, lifelike clothing
images by integrating multi-scale features and capturing extensive feature map
dependencies from diverse perspectives. Through extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations conducted on our self-collected dataset, our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in generating
photorealistic clothing images. Our method excels in preserving the distinctive
style and intricate details essential for fashion design applications.

results suggest that heuristic-based clustering methods in conjunction with
object trackers can be used to pseudo-label instances of moving objects and use
these as supervisory signals to train 3D object detectors in Lidar data without
manual supervision. We re-think this approach and suggest that both, object
detection, as well as motion-inspired pseudo-labeling, can be tackled in a
data-driven manner. We leverage recent advances in scene flow estimation to
obtain point trajectories from which we extract long-term, class-agnostic
motion patterns. Revisiting correlation clustering in the context of message
passing networks, we learn to group those motion patterns to cluster points to
object instances. By estimating the full extent of the objects, we obtain
per-scan 3D bounding boxes that we use to supervise a Lidar object detection
network. Our method not only outperforms prior heuristic-based approaches (57.5
AP, +14 improvement over prior work), more importantly, we show we can
pseudo-label and train object detectors across datasets.

noisy information by extracting specific features such as texture, edges, and
other thin image structures. We are interested here in generative models, and
two main problems are addressed. Firstly, the improvements of specific feature
extraction while accounting at multiscale levels intrinsic geometric features;
and secondly, the equivariance of the network to reduce its complexity and
provide a geometric interpretability. To proceed, we propose a geometric
generative model based on an equivariant partial differential equation (PDE)
for group convolution neural networks (G-CNNs), so called PDE-G-CNNs, built on
morphology operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Equivariant
morphological PDE layers are composed of multiscale dilations and erosions
formulated in Riemannian manifolds, while group symmetries are defined on a Lie
group. We take advantage of the Lie group structure to properly integrate the
equivariance in layers, and are able to use the Riemannian metric to solve the
multiscale morphological operations. Each point of the Lie group is associated
with a unique point in the manifold, which helps us derive a metric on the
Riemannian manifold from a tensor field invariant under the Lie group so that
the induced metric has the same symmetries. The proposed geometric
morphological GAN (GM-GAN) is obtained by using the proposed morphological
equivariant convolutions in PDE-G-CNNs to bring nonlinearity in classical CNNs.
GM-GAN is evaluated on MNIST data and compared with GANs. Preliminary results
show that GM-GAN model outperforms classical GAN.

space while keeping the depth information and physical structure. That is
essential for applications that require precise pose information, such as
human-computer interaction, scene understanding, and rehabilitation training.
Due to the challenges in data collection, mainstream datasets of 3D human pose
estimation are primarily composed of multi-view video data collected in
laboratory environments, which contains rich spatial-temporal correlation
information besides the image frame content. Given the remarkable
self-attention mechanism of transformers, capable of capturing the
spatial-temporal correlation from multi-view video datasets, we propose a
multi-stage framework for 3D sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) human pose
detection. Firstly, the spatial module represents the human pose feature by
intra-image content, while the frame-image relation module extracts temporal
relationships and 3D spatial positional relationship features between the
multi-perspective images. Secondly, the self-attention mechanism is adopted to
eliminate the interference from non-human body parts and reduce computing
resources. Our method is evaluated on Human3.6M, a popular 3D human pose
detection dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on this dataset. The source code will be available

of speed of actions, temporal locations, and subjects' poses, leading to
temporal-viewpoint misalignment when comparing two sets of frames or evaluating
the similarity of two sequences. Thus, we propose Joint tEmporal and cAmera
viewpoiNt alIgnmEnt (JEANIE) for sequence pairs. In particular, we focus on 3D
skeleton sequences whose camera and subjects' poses can be easily manipulated
in 3D. We evaluate JEANIE on skeletal Few-shot Action Recognition (FSAR), where
matching well temporal blocks (temporal chunks that make up a sequence) of
support-query sequence pairs (by factoring out nuisance variations) is
essential due to limited samples of novel classes. Given a query sequence, we
create its several views by simulating several camera locations. For a support
sequence, we match it with view-simulated query sequences, as in the popular
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Specifically, each support temporal block can be
matched to the query temporal block with the same or adjacent (next) temporal
index, and adjacent camera views to achieve joint local temporal-viewpoint
warping. JEANIE selects the smallest distance among matching paths with
different temporal-viewpoint warping patterns, an advantage over DTW which only
performs temporal alignment. We also propose an unsupervised FSAR akin to
clustering of sequences with JEANIE as a distance measure. JEANIE achieves
state-of-the-art results on NTU-60, NTU-120, Kinetics-skeleton and UWA3D
Multiview Activity II on supervised and unsupervised FSAR, and their

                                        <span>  In this study, we identify the inefficient attention phenomena in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), notably within prominent models like LLaVA-1.5,
QwenVL-Chat and Video-LLaVA. We find out that the attention computation over
visual tokens is of extreme inefficiency in the deep layers of popular LVLMs,
suggesting a need for a sparser approach compared to textual data handling. To
this end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed to
optimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns in
early layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluations
demonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a
45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in a
wide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiency
and performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable and
pareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achieve
a lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintaining
superior performance. We believe FastV has practical values for deployment of
LVLMs in edge devices and commercial models. Code is released at

                                        <span>  Recent years have seen significant advancements in image restoration, largely
attributed to the development of modern deep neural networks, such as CNNs and
Transformers. However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma
between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their
application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model,
especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range
dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the
above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in
low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this
work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which
introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla
Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity
and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to
0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global
receptive field. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/csguoh/MambaIR}.

uses a pre-trained and frozen visual encoder and large language model (LLM) to
process long video sequences for a task. TCR localises relevant visual features
from the video given a text condition and provides them to a LLM to generate a
text response. Due to its lightweight design and use of cross-attention, TCR
can process more than 100 frames at a time with plain attention and without
optimised implementations. We make the following contributions: (i) we design a
transformer-based sampling architecture that can process long videos
conditioned on a task, together with a training method that enables it to
bridge pre-trained visual and language models; (ii) we identify tasks that
could benefit from longer video perception; and (iii) we empirically validate
its efficacy on a wide variety of evaluation tasks including NextQA, EgoSchema,
and the EGO4D-LTA challenge.

                                        <span>  We propose EMAGE, a framework to generate full-body human gestures from audio
and masked gestures, encompassing facial, local body, hands, and global
movements. To achieve this, we first introduce BEAT2 (BEAT-SMPLX-FLAME), a new
mesh-level holistic co-speech dataset. BEAT2 combines MoShed SMPLX body with
FLAME head parameters and further refines the modeling of head, neck, and
finger movements, offering a community-standardized, high-quality 3D motion
captured dataset. EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to
boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer,
facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture
reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body
hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and
body movements. Moreover, EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the
audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance
the results' fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that EMAGE
generates holistic gestures with state-of-the-art performance and is flexible
in accepting predefined spatial-temporal gesture inputs, generating complete,
audio-synchronized results. Our code and dataset are available at

that fuses inputs from multiple sources into a memory-like structure, improving
the storing capacity and extracting more intrinsic and correlated information.
BioNeRF also mimics a behavior observed in pyramidal cells concerning
contextual information, in which the memory is provided as the context and
combined with the inputs of two subsequent neural models, one responsible for
producing the volumetric densities and the other the colors used to render the
scene. Experimental results show that BioNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art

cognitive framework for diverse visual-language tasks. Recent efforts have been
made to equip MLLMs with visual perceiving and grounding capabilities. However,
there still remains a gap in providing fine-grained pixel-level perceptions and
extending interactions beyond text-specific inputs. In this work, we propose
{\bf{AnyRef}}, a general MLLM model that can generate pixel-wise object
perceptions and natural language descriptions from multi-modality references,
such as texts, boxes, images, or audio. This innovation empowers users with
greater flexibility to engage with the model beyond textual and regional
prompts, without modality-specific designs. Through our proposed refocusing
mechanism, the generated grounding output is guided to better focus on the
referenced object, implicitly incorporating additional pixel-level supervision.
This simple modification utilizes attention scores generated during the
inference of LLM, eliminating the need for extra computations while exhibiting
performance enhancements in both grounding masks and referring expressions.
With only publicly available training data, our model achieves state-of-the-art
results across multiple benchmarks, including diverse modality referring

                                        <span>  Adversarial examples mislead deep neural networks with imperceptible
perturbations and have brought significant threats to deep learning. An
important aspect is their transferability, which refers to their ability to
deceive other models, thus enabling attacks in the black-box setting. Though
various methods have been proposed to boost transferability, the performance
still falls short compared with white-box attacks. In this work, we observe
that existing input transformation based attacks, one of the mainstream
transfer-based attacks, result in different attention heatmaps on various
models, which might limit the transferability. We also find that breaking the
intrinsic relation of the image can disrupt the attention heatmap of the
original image. Based on this finding, we propose a novel input transformation
based attack called block shuffle and rotation (BSR). Specifically, BSR splits
the input image into several blocks, then randomly shuffles and rotates these
blocks to construct a set of new images for gradient calculation. Empirical
evaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that BSR could achieve
significantly better transferability than the existing input transformation
based methods under single-model and ensemble-model settings. Combining BSR
with the current input transformation method can further improve the
transferability, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  Searching for specific person has great social benefits and security value,
and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information.
Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based,
usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading
to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person
Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information
for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR requires very costly
manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To
mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person
Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the
CPR problem without expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we
propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual
Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on
fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned
without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed
Person Retrieval (ITCPR) dataset is built as the benchmark to assess the
performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under
both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR
task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10\%. The code and ITCPR
dataset will be publicly available at

                                        <span>  The advancement of knowledge distillation has played a crucial role in
enabling the transfer of knowledge from larger teacher models to smaller and
more efficient student models, and is particularly beneficial for online and
resource-constrained applications. The effectiveness of the student model
heavily relies on the quality of the distilled knowledge received from the
teacher. Given the accessibility of unlabelled remote sensing data,
semi-supervised learning has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing model
performance. However, relying solely on semi-supervised learning with smaller
models may be insufficient due to their limited capacity for feature
extraction. This limitation restricts their ability to exploit training data.
To address this issue, we propose an integrated approach that combines
knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning methods. This hybrid
approach leverages the robust capabilities of large models to effectively
utilise large unlabelled data whilst subsequently providing the small student
model with rich and informative features for enhancement. The proposed
semi-supervised learning-based knowledge distillation (SSLKD) approach
demonstrates a notable improvement in the performance of the student model, in
the application of road segmentation, surpassing the effectiveness of
traditional semi-supervised learning methods.

intelligent vehicles and have become an important component of the Web
ecosystem. Similar to traditional Web-based applications, fairness is an
essential aspect for ensuring the high quality of autonomous driving systems,
particularly in the context of pedestrian detectors within them. However, there
is an absence in the literature of a comprehensive assessment of the fairness
of current Deep Learning (DL)-based pedestrian detectors. To fill the gap, we
evaluate eight widely-explored DL-based pedestrian detectors across demographic
groups on large-scale real-world datasets. To enable a thorough fairness
evaluation, we provide extensive annotations for the datasets, resulting in
8,311 images with 16,070 gender labels, 20,115 age labels, and 3,513 skin tone
labels. Our findings reveal significant fairness issues related to age. The
undetected proportions for adults are 20.14% lower compared to children.
Furthermore, we explore how various driving scenarios affect the fairness of
pedestrian detectors. We find that the bias may exacerbate for children and
females towards low brightness and low contrast.

diffusion-based zero-shot novel view synthesis methods. Second, capitalizing on
the RGNV, we present a novel Reference-Guided State Distillation (RGSD) loss.
When incorporated into the optimization-based image-to-3D pipeline, our method
significantly improves 3D generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art

                                        <span>  Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVGs) synthesis has shown
promise in domains such as iconography and sketch. However, existing
text-to-SVG generation methods lack editability and struggle with visual
quality and result diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
text-guided vector graphics synthesis method called SVGDreamer. SVGDreamer
incorporates a semantic-driven image vectorization (SIVE) process that enables
the decomposition of synthesis into foreground objects and background, thereby
enhancing editability. Specifically, the SIVE process introduce attention-based
primitive control and an attention-mask loss function for effective control and
manipulation of individual elements. Additionally, we propose a Vectorized
Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach to tackle the challenges of
shape over-smoothing, color over-saturation, limited diversity in results, and
slow convergence in existing text-to-SVG generation methods. VPSD models SVGs
as distributions of control points and colors to counteract over-smoothing and
over-saturation. Furthermore, VPSD leverages a reward model to reweight vector
particles, which improves aesthetic appeal and accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of
SVGDreamer, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of
editability, visual quality, and diversity. The code and demo of SVGDreamer can
be found at https://ximinng.github.io/SVGDreamer-project/

                                        <span>  Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in
computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image
representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven
regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit
regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches
consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a
generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However,
state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data
compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization
involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use
compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as
variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier
to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we
introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which
performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference.
Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior,
VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental
results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar
performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to
quantify uncertainties faster than other existing posterior sampling
techniques.

                                        <span>  Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that requires an
algorithm to segment objects referred by free-form language expressions.
Despite significant progress in recent years, most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods still suffer from considerable language-image modality gap at the pixel
and word level. These methods generally 1) rely on sentence-level language
features for language-image alignment and 2) lack explicit training supervision
for fine-grained visual grounding. Consequently, they exhibit weak object-level
correspondence between visual and language features. Without well-grounded
features, prior methods struggle to understand complex expressions that require
strong reasoning over relationships among multiple objects, especially when
dealing with rarely used or ambiguous clauses. To tackle this challenge, we
introduce a novel Mask Grounding auxiliary task that significantly improves
visual grounding within language features, by explicitly teaching the model to
learn fine-grained correspondence between masked textual tokens and their
matching visual objects. Mask Grounding can be directly used on prior RIS
methods and consistently bring improvements. Furthermore, to holistically
address the modality gap, we also design a cross-modal alignment loss and an
accompanying alignment module. These additions work synergistically with Mask
Grounding. With all these techniques, our comprehensive approach culminates in
MagNet (Mask-grounded Network), an architecture that significantly outperforms
prior arts on three key benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and G-Ref), demonstrating
our method's effectiveness in addressing current limitations of RIS algorithms.
Our code and pre-trained weights will be released.

creative vision and transform design concepts into tangible representations
that showcase the interplay between clothing and the human body. In the context
of fashion design, computer vision techniques have the potential to enhance and
streamline the design process. Departing from prior research primarily focused
on virtual try-on, this paper tackles the task of multimodal-conditioned
fashion image editing. Our approach aims to generate human-centric fashion
images guided by multimodal prompts, including text, human body poses, garment
sketches, and fabric textures. To address this problem, we propose extending
latent diffusion models to incorporate these multiple modalities and modifying
the structure of the denoising network, taking multimodal prompts as input. To
condition the proposed architecture on fabric textures, we employ textual
inversion techniques and let diverse cross-attention layers of the denoising
network attend to textual and texture information, thus incorporating different
granularity conditioning details. Given the lack of datasets for the task, we
extend two existing fashion datasets, Dress Code and VITON-HD, with multimodal
annotations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach in terms of realism and coherence concerning the provided
multimodal inputs.

generation. Recent generative methods lack lighting control, which is crucial
to numerous artistic aspects of image generation such as setting the overall
mood or cinematic appearance. To overcome these limitations, we propose to
condition the generation on shading and normal maps. We model the lighting with
single bounce shading, which includes cast shadows. We first train a shading
estimation module to generate a dataset of real-world images and shading pairs.
Then, we train a control network using the estimated shading and normals as
input. Our method demonstrates high-quality image generation and lighting
control in numerous scenes. Additionally, we use our generated dataset to train
an identity-preserving relighting model, conditioned on an image and a target
shading. Our method is the first that enables the generation of images with
controllable, consistent lighting and performs on par with specialized
relighting state-of-the-art methods.

pain and improving mobility. While arthroplasty has known several technical
improvements, a significant share of patients are still unsatisfied with their
surgery. Personalised arthroplasty improves surgical outcomes however current
solutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical routine.
We propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific implants,
presented for total knee arthroplasty, the most widely performed arthroplasty
in the world nowadays.
  The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to segment the
proximal and distal extremities of the femur and tibia. Then the full bones are
reconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and
landmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to
design patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained using
91 CT scans of lower limb and evaluated on 41 CT scans manually segmented, in
terms of accuracy and execution time.
  The workflow accuracy was $0.4\pm0.2mm$ for the segmentation, $1.2\pm0.4mm$
for the full bones reconstruction, and $2.8\pm2.2mm$ for the anatomical
landmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with
$0.6\pm0.2mm$ accuracy. The whole process from segmentation to implants' design
lasted about 5 minutes.
  The proposed workflow allows for a fast and reliable personalisation of knee
implants, directly from the patient CT image without requiring any manual
intervention. It establishes a patient-specific pre-operative planning for TKA
in a very short time making it easily available for all patients. Combined with
efficient implant manufacturing techniques, this solution could help answer the
growing number of arthroplasties while reducing complications and improving the
patients' satisfaction.

i.e. the challenge of joint semantic image splitting and unsupervised
denoising. This dual approach has important applications in fluorescence
microscopy, where semantic image splitting has important applications but noise
does generally hinder the downstream analysis of image content. Image splitting
involves dissecting an image into its distinguishable semantic structures. We
show that the current state-of-the-art method for this task struggles in the
presence of image noise, inadvertently also distributing the noise across the
predicted outputs. The method we present here can deal with image noise by
integrating an unsupervised denoising sub-task. This integration results in
improved semantic image unmixing, even in the presence of notable and realistic
levels of imaging noise. A key innovation in denoiSplit is the use of
specifically formulated noise models and the suitable adjustment of
KL-divergence loss for the high-dimensional hierarchical latent space we are
training. We showcase the performance of denoiSplit across 4 tasks on
real-world microscopy images. Additionally, we perform qualitative and
quantitative evaluations and compare results to existing benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of using denoiSplit: a single Variational
Splitting Encoder-Decoder (VSE) Network using two suitable noise models to
jointly perform semantic splitting and denoising.

                                        <span>  Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a challenging task that involves
accurately segmenting sounding objects based on audio-visual cues. The
effectiveness of audio-visual learning critically depends on achieving accurate
cross-modal alignment between sound and visual objects. Successful audio-visual
learning requires two essential components: 1) a challenging dataset with
high-quality pixel-level multi-class annotated images associated with audio
files, and 2) a model that can establish strong links between audio information
and its corresponding visual object. However, these requirements are only
partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased
audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased
training set. In this work, we propose a new cost-effective strategy to build
challenging and relatively unbiased high-quality audio-visual segmentation
benchmarks. We also propose a new informative sample mining method for
audio-visual supervised contrastive learning to leverage discriminative
contrastive samples to enforce cross-modal understanding. We show empirical
results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark. Furthermore,
experiments conducted on existing AVS datasets and on our new benchmark show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation accuracy.

mechanism for target-specific supervision--into the CLIP framework for improved
zero-shot transfer on human-centric tasks. Our novel contributions enhance CLIP
on both the vision and text sides. On the vision side, we incorporate ROI
heatmaps emulating human visual attention mechanisms to emphasize
subject-relevant image regions. On the text side, we introduce human pose
descriptions to provide rich contextual information. For human-centric tasks,
FocusCLIP is trained with images from the MPII Human Pose dataset. The proposed
approach surpassed CLIP by an average of 8.61% across five previously unseen
datasets covering three human-centric tasks. FocusCLIP achieved an average
accuracy of 33.65% compared to 25.04% by CLIP. We observed a 3.98% improvement
in activity recognition, a 14.78% improvement in age classification, and a
7.06% improvement in emotion recognition. Moreover, using our proposed
single-shot LLM prompting strategy, we release a high-quality MPII Pose
Descriptions dataset to encourage further research in multimodal learning for
human-centric tasks. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our
subject-level supervision on non-human-centric tasks. FocusCLIP shows a 2.47%
improvement over CLIP in zero-shot bird classification using the CUB dataset.
Our findings emphasize the potential of integrating subject-level guidance with
general pretraining methods for enhanced downstream performance.

image denoising techniques. However, the persistent challenge of acquiring
noise-clean pairs for supervised methods in real-world scenarios remains
formidable, necessitating the exploration of more practical self-supervised
image denoising. This paper focuses on self-supervised image denoising methods
that offer effective solutions to address this challenge. Our comprehensive
review thoroughly analyzes the latest advancements in self-supervised image
denoising approaches, categorizing them into three distinct classes: General
methods, Blind Spot Network (BSN)-based methods, and Transformer-based methods.
For each class, we provide a concise theoretical analysis along with their
practical applications. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we
present both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on various
datasets, utilizing classical algorithms as benchmarks. Additionally, we
critically discuss the current limitations of these methods and propose
promising directions for future research. By offering a detailed overview of
recent developments in self-supervised image denoising, this review serves as
an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field,

                                        <span>  Creating personalized hand avatars is important to offer a realistic
experience to users on AR / VR platforms. While most prior studies focused on
reconstructing 3D hand shapes, some recent work has tackled the reconstruction
of hand textures on top of shapes. However, these methods are often limited to
capturing pixels on the visible side of a hand, requiring diverse views of the
hand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands), which is the
first end-to-end trainable method for relightable, pose-free texture
reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image, by
three novel components: 1) bi-directional (left $\leftrightarrow$ right)
texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands, 2)
utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery, and 3) the
overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture
of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and
albedo image from an input image, then reconstructs the texture of both hands
through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor.
In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methods
quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is available at

urban areas, thanks to their very high spatial and spectral resolutions on a
wide spectral domain. While the spectral dimension of hyperspectral images is
highly informative of the chemical composition of the land surface, the use of
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to map the land cover has been
dramatically limited by the availability of training data. To cope with the
scarcity of annotations, semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques have
lately raised a lot of interest in the community. Yet, the publicly available
hyperspectral data sets commonly used to benchmark machine learning models are
not totally suited to evaluate their generalization performances due to one or
several of the following properties: a limited geographical coverage (which
does not reflect the spectral diversity in metropolitan areas), a small number
of land cover classes and a lack of appropriate standard train / test splits
for semi-supervised and self-supervised learning. Therefore, we release in this
paper the Toulouse Hyperspectral Data Set that stands out from other data sets
in the above-mentioned respects in order to meet key issues in spectral
representation learning and classification over large-scale hyperspectral
images with very few labeled pixels. Besides, we discuss and experiment
self-supervised techniques for spectral representation learning, including the
Masked Autoencoder, and establish a baseline for pixel-wise classification
achieving 85% overall accuracy and 77% F1 score. The Toulouse Hyperspectral
Data Set and our code are publicly available at

demand for human point clouds with realistic and intricate details. The
compression of such data becomes challenging with overwhelming data amounts
comprising millions of points. Herein, we leverage the human geometric prior in
geometry redundancy removal of point clouds, greatly promoting the compression
performance. More specifically, the prior provides topological constraints as
geometry initialization, allowing adaptive adjustments with a compact parameter
set that could be represented with only a few bits. Therefore, we can envisage
high-resolution human point clouds as a combination of geometric priors and
structural deviations. The priors could first be derived with an aligned point
cloud, and subsequently the difference of features is compressed into a compact
latent code. The proposed framework can operate in a play-and-plug fashion with
existing learning based point cloud compression methods. Extensive experimental
results show that our approach significantly improves the compression
performance without deteriorating the quality, demonstrating its promise in a
variety of applications.

                                        <span>  Large multi-modal models (LMMs) hold the potential to usher in a new era of
automated visual assistance for people who are blind or low vision (BLV). Yet,
these models have not been systematically evaluated on data captured by BLV
users. We address this by empirically assessing CLIP, a widely-used LMM likely
to underpin many assistive technologies. Testing 25 CLIP variants in a
zero-shot classification task, we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage
points lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled
images. This disparity stems from CLIP's sensitivities to 1) image content
(e.g. not recognizing disability objects as well as other objects); 2) image
quality (e.g. not being robust to lighting variation); and 3) text content
(e.g. not recognizing objects described by tactile adjectives as well as visual
ones). We delve deeper with a textual analysis of three common pre-training
datasets: LAION-400M, LAION-2B and DataComp-1B, showing that disability content
is rarely mentioned. We then provide three examples that illustrate how the
performance disparities extend to three downstream models underpinned by CLIP:
OWL-ViT, CLIPSeg and DALL-E2. We find that few-shot learning with as few as 5
images can mitigate CLIP's quality-of-service disparities for BLV users in some
scenarios, which we discuss alongside a set of other possible mitigations.

                                        <span>  Facial Attribute Classification (FAC) holds substantial promise in widespread
applications. However, FAC models trained by traditional methodologies can be
unfair by exhibiting accuracy inconsistencies across varied data
subpopulations. This unfairness is largely attributed to bias in data, where
some spurious attributes (e.g., Male) statistically correlate with the target
attribute (e.g., Smiling). Most of existing fairness-aware methods rely on the
labels of spurious attributes, which may be unavailable in practice. This work
proposes a novel, generation-based two-stage framework to train a fair FAC
model on biased data without additional annotation. Initially, we identify the
potential spurious attributes based on generative models. Notably, it enhances
interpretability by explicitly showing the spurious attributes in image space.
Following this, for each image, we first edit the spurious attributes with a
random degree sampled from a uniform distribution, while keeping target
attribute unchanged. Then we train a fair FAC model by fostering model
invariance to these augmentation. Extensive experiments on three common
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in promoting fairness in
FAC without compromising accuracy. Codes are in

evaluate the perceptual quality of distorted point clouds without available
reference, which have achieved tremendous improvements due to the utilization
of deep neural networks. However, learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from
the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform suboptimally in terms of
generalization. To solve the problem, we propose a novel contrastive
pre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA), which enables the pre-trained
model to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. To obtain
anchors in the representation space, we project point clouds with different
distortions into images and randomly mix their local patches to form mixed
images with multiple distortions. Utilizing the generated anchors, we constrain
the pre-training process via a quality-aware contrastive loss following the
philosophy that perceptual quality is closely related to both content and
distortion. Furthermore, in the model fine-tuning stage, we propose a
semantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate the features
of projected images from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments show that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCQA methods on popular benchmarks.
Further investigations demonstrate that CoPA can also benefit existing
learning-based PCQA models.

analysis-by-synthesis method that processes images captured under diverse
illuminations to estimate shape and spatially-varying BRDF. To this end, we
adopt point-based rendering, eliminating the need for multiple samplings per
ray, typical of volumetric rendering, thus significantly enhancing the speed of
inverse rendering. To realize this idea, we devise a hybrid point-volumetric
representation for geometry and a regularized basis-BRDF representation for
reflectance. The hybrid geometric representation enables fast rendering through
point-based splatting while retaining the geometric details and stability
inherent to SDF-based representations. The regularized basis-BRDF mitigates the
ill-posedness of inverse rendering stemming from limited light-view angular
samples. We also propose an efficient shadow detection method using point-based
shadow map rendering. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DPIR
outperforms prior works in terms of reconstruction accuracy, computational
efficiency, and memory footprint. Furthermore, our explicit point-based
representation and rendering enables intuitive geometry and reflectance
editing.

integrated with a mask-aware post-processing technique ensuring the integrity

                                        <span>  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased impressive skills in
tasks related to visual understanding and reasoning. Yet, their widespread
application faces obstacles due to the high computational demands during both
the training and inference phases, restricting their use to a limited audience
within the research and user communities. In this paper, we investigate the
design aspects of Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) and propose an
efficient multimodal assistant named Mipha, which is designed to create synergy
among various aspects: visual representation, language models, and optimization
strategies. We show that without increasing the volume of training data, our
Mipha-3B outperforms the state-of-the-art large MLLMs, especially
LLaVA-1.5-13B, on multiple benchmarks. Through detailed discussion, we provide
insights and guidelines for developing strong MSLMs that rival the capabilities
of MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhuyiche/llava-phi.

                                        <span>  Hyperspectral 3D imaging aims to acquire both depth and spectral information
of a scene. However, existing methods are either prohibitively expensive and
bulky or compromise on spectral and depth accuracy. In this work, we present
Dispersed Structured Light (DSL), a cost-effective and compact method for
accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL modifies a traditional projector-camera
system by placing a sub-millimeter thick diffraction grating film front of the
projector. The grating disperses structured light based on light wavelength. To
utilize the dispersed structured light, we devise a model for dispersive
projection image formation and a per-pixel hyperspectral 3D reconstruction
method. We validate DSL by instantiating a compact experimental prototype. DSL
achieves spectral accuracy of 18.8nm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) and depth
error of 1mm. We demonstrate that DSL outperforms prior work on practical
hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL promises accurate and practical hyperspectral 3D
imaging for diverse application domains, including computer vision and
graphics, cultural heritage, geology, and biology.

revolutionized content creation, empowering non-experts to generate stunning
images with unique styles. While promising, adding realistic motions into these
personalized images by text poses significant challenges in preserving distinct
styles, high-fidelity details, and achieving motion controllability by text. In
this paper, we present PIA, a Personalized Image Animator that excels in
aligning with condition images, achieving motion controllability by text, and
the compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning.
To achieve these goals, PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained
temporal alignment layers, allowing for the seamless transformation of any
personalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is
the introduction of the condition module, which utilizes the condition frame
and inter-frame affinity as input to transfer appearance information guided by
the affinity hint for individual frame synthesis in the latent space. This
design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related image alignment within
and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance.

stationary scenes, creating a gap in evaluating agents' abilities to interact
with dynamic events. While contemporary methods allow agents to modify initial
scene configurations and observe consequences, they lack the capability to
interact with events in real time. To address this, we introduce I-PHYRE, a
framework that challenges agents to simultaneously exhibit intuitive physical
reasoning, multi-step planning, and in-situ intervention. Here, intuitive
physical reasoning refers to a quick, approximate understanding of physics to
address complex problems; multi-step denotes the need for extensive sequence
planning in I-PHYRE, considering each intervention can significantly alter
subsequent choices; and in-situ implies the necessity for timely object
manipulation within a scene, where minor timing deviations can result in task
failure. We formulate four game splits to scrutinize agents' learning and
generalization of essential principles of interactive physical reasoning,
fostering learning through interaction with representative scenarios. Our
exploration involves three planning strategies and examines several supervised
and reinforcement agents' zero-shot generalization proficiency on I-PHYRE. The
outcomes highlight a notable gap between existing learning algorithms and human
performance, emphasizing the imperative for more research in enhancing agents
with interactive physical reasoning capabilities. The environment and baselines
will be made publicly available.

the D3C-cos variant, offering a streamlined yet precise solution. Furthermore,
we propose the D2C method, redefining conceptual boundaries within these

lower-dimensional counterparts. Finally, we extend our methodology to D4C,
employing adversarial techniques to refine conceptual boundaries further and

                                        <span>  We tackle the issue of generalized category discovery (GCD). GCD considers
the open-world problem of automatically clustering a partially labelled
dataset, in which the unlabelled data may contain instances from both novel
categories and labelled classes. In this paper, we address the GCD problem with
an unknown category number for the unlabelled data. We propose a framework,
named CiPR, to bootstrap the representation by exploiting Cross-instance
Positive Relations in the partially labelled data for contrastive learning,
which have been neglected in existing methods. To obtain reliable
cross-instance relations to facilitate representation learning, we introduce a
semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, named selective neighbor
clustering (SNC), which can produce a clustering hierarchy directly from the
connected components of a graph constructed from selective neighbors. We
further present a method to estimate the unknown class number using SNC with a
joint reference score that considers clustering indexes of both labelled and
unlabelled data, and extend SNC to allow label assignment for the unlabelled
instances with a given class number. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on
public generic image recognition datasets and challenging fine-grained
datasets, and establish a new state-of-the-art. Code:

instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various
multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations
inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs
in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various
hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate
those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual
instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors,
we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework,
HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to
identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically.
Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising
from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on
that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data
distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations.
Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our
method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains
competitive performance compared to LLaVA. The data and code for this paper are
publicly available. \url{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor}.

                                        <span>  For a long time, in reconstructing 3D human bodies from monocular images,
most methods opted to simplify the task by minimizing the influence of the
camera. Using a coarse focal length setting results in the reconstructed bodies
not aligning well with distorted images. Ignoring camera rotation leads to an
unrealistic reconstructed body pose in world space. Consequently, the
application scenarios of existing methods are confined to controlled
environments. When confronted with complex and diverse in-the-wild images, they
struggle to achieve accurate and reasonable reconstruction in world space. To
address the above issues, we propose W-HMR, which decouples global body
recovery into camera calibration, local body recovery, and global body
orientation correction. We design the first weak-supervised camera calibration
method for body distortion, eliminating dependence on focal length labels and
achieving finer mesh-image alignment. We propose a novel orientation correction
module to allow the reconstructed human body to remain normal in world space.
Decoupling body orientation and body pose enables our model to consider the
accuracy in camera coordinate and the reasonableness in world coordinate
simultaneously, expanding the range of applications. As a result, W-HMR
achieves high-quality reconstruction in dual coordinate systems, particularly
in challenging scenes. Codes and demos have been released on the project page

                                        <span>  Despite recent advancements in semantic segmentation, where and what pixels
are hard to segment remains largely unexplored. Existing research only
separates an image into easy and hard regions and empirically observes the
latter are associated with object boundaries. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of hard pixel errors, categorizing them into three
types: false responses, merging mistakes, and displacements. Our findings
reveal a quantitative association between hard pixels and aliasing, which is
distortion caused by the overlapping of frequency components in the Fourier
domain during downsampling. To identify the frequencies responsible for
aliasing, we propose using the equivalent sampling rate to calculate the
Nyquist frequency, which marks the threshold for aliasing. Then, we introduce
the aliasing score as a metric to quantify the extent of aliasing. While
positively correlated with the proposed aliasing score, three types of hard
pixels exhibit different patterns. Here, we propose two novel de-aliasing
filter (DAF) and frequency mixing (FreqMix) modules to alleviate aliasing
degradation by accurately removing or adjusting frequencies higher than the
Nyquist frequency. The DAF precisely removes the frequencies responsible for
aliasing before downsampling, while the FreqMix dynamically selects
high-frequency components within the encoder block. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic segmentation and low-light
instance segmentation tasks. The code is available at:

(cellVIB), a convolutional neural network using information bottleneck
mechanism, which can be combined with the latest feedforward network
architecture in an end-to-end training method. Our Cell Variational Information
Bottleneck Network is constructed by stacking VIB cells, which generate feature
maps with uncertainty. As layers going deeper, the regularization effect will
gradually increase, instead of directly adding excessive regular constraints to
the output layer of the model as in Deep VIB. Under each VIB cell, the
feedforward process learns an independent mean term and an standard deviation
term, and predicts the Gaussian distribution based on them. The feedback
process is based on reparameterization trick for effective training. This work
performs an extensive analysis on MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of
each VIB cells, and provides an insightful analysis on how the VIB cells affect
mutual information. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 also prove that our
cellVIB is robust against noisy labels during training and against corrupted
images during testing. Then, we validate our method on PACS dataset, whose
results show that the VIB cells can significantly improve the generalization
performance of the basic model. Finally, in a more complex representation
learning task, face recognition, our network structure has also achieved very
competitive results.

doing data augmentation as it not only brings appearance changes that are
detrimental to classification, but also the implementation is inefficient in
practice. In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the
context of video understanding and find this variance to be beneficial since
static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion
information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method
for video understanding, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that
introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model
to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we
propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video
samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution
shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant
representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various
architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and
generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/BeSpontaneous/MCA-pytorch.

                                        <span>  Large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common approach for
generating training data in various generative fields. However, visual
hallucinations, which contain perceptually critical defects, remain a concern,
especially in non-photorealistic styles like cartoon characters. We propose a
novel visual hallucination detection system for cartoon character images
generated by TTI models. Our approach leverages pose-aware in-context visual
learning (PA-ICVL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing both RGB
images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance from a fine-tuned
pose estimator, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual
hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. This
research advances TTI models by mitigating visual hallucinations, expanding
their potential in non-photorealistic domains.

                                        <span>  Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) is a compelling topic in the
cross-modal community, which aims to retrieve the target person based on a
textual query. Although numerous TIReID methods have been proposed and achieved
promising performance, they implicitly assume the training image-text pairs are
correctly aligned, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. In
practice, the image-text pairs inevitably exist under-correlated or even
false-correlated, a.k.a noisy correspondence (NC), due to the low quality of
the images and annotation errors. To address this problem, we propose a novel
Robust Dual Embedding method (RDE) that can learn robust visual-semantic
associations even with NC. Specifically, RDE consists of two main components:
1) A Confident Consensus Division (CCD) module that leverages the dual-grained
decisions of dual embedding modules to obtain a consensus set of clean training
data, which enables the model to learn correct and reliable visual-semantic
associations. 2) A Triplet Alignment Loss (TAL) relaxes the conventional
Triplet Ranking loss with the hardest negative samples to a log-exponential
upper bound over all negative ones, thus preventing the model collapse under NC
and can also focus on hard-negative samples for promising performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, namely CUHK-PEDES,
ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID, to evaluate the performance and robustness of our
RDE. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results both with and without
synthetic noisy correspondences on all three datasets. Code is available at

                                        <span>  The emergence of diffusion models has revolutionized the field of image
generation, providing new methods for creating high-quality, high-resolution
images across various applications. However, the potential of these models for
generating domain-specific images, particularly remote sensing (RS) images,
remains largely untapped. RS images that are notable for their high resolution,
extensive coverage, and rich information content, bring new challenges that
general diffusion models may not adequately address. This paper proposes
CRS-Diff, a pioneering diffusion modeling framework specifically tailored for
generating remote sensing imagery, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models while integrating advanced control mechanisms to ensure that
the imagery is not only visually clear but also enriched with geographic and
temporal information. The model integrates global and local control inputs,
enabling precise combinations of generation conditions to refine the generation
process. A comprehensive evaluation of CRS-Diff has demonstrated its superior
capability to generate RS imagery both in a single condition and multiple
conditions compared with previous methods in terms of image quality and
diversity.

for semantic correspondence, their features often struggle to grasp the
geometry and orientation of instances. This paper identifies the importance of
being geometry-aware for semantic correspondence and reveals a limitation of
the features of current foundation models under simple post-processing. We show
that incorporating this information can markedly enhance semantic
correspondence performance with simple but effective solutions in both
zero-shot and supervised settings. We also construct a new challenging
benchmark for semantic correspondence built from an existing animal pose
estimation dataset, for both pre-training validating models. Our method
achieves a PCK@0.10 score of 65.4 (zero-shot) and 85.6 (supervised) on the

(LLMs) as reasoning modules that can deconstruct complex tasks into more
manageable sub-tasks, particularly when applied to visual reasoning tasks for
images. In contrast, this paper introduces a Video Understanding and Reasoning
Framework (VURF) based on the reasoning power of LLMs. Ours is a novel approach
to extend the utility of LLMs in the context of video tasks, leveraging their
capacity to generalize from minimal input and output demonstrations within a
contextual framework. By presenting LLMs with pairs of instructions and their
corresponding high-level programs, we harness their contextual learning
capabilities to generate executable visual programs for video understanding. To
enhance program's accuracy and robustness, we implement two important
strategies. Firstly, we employ a feedback-generation approach, powered by
GPT-3.5, to rectify errors in programs utilizing unsupported functions.
Secondly, taking motivation from recent works on self refinement of LLM
outputs, we introduce an iterative procedure for improving the quality of the
in-context examples by aligning the initial outputs to the outputs that would
have been generated had the LLM not been bound by the structure of the
in-context examples. Our results on several video-specific tasks, including
visual QA, video anticipation, pose estimation and multi-video QA illustrate
the efficacy of these enhancements in improving the performance of visual
programming approaches for video tasks.

                                        <span>  We propose a novel rolling shutter bundle adjustment method for neural
radiance fields (NeRF), which utilizes the unordered rolling shutter (RS)
images to obtain the implicit 3D representation. Existing NeRF methods suffer
from low-quality images and inaccurate initial camera poses due to the RS
effect in the image, whereas, the previous method that incorporates the RS into
NeRF requires strict sequential data input, limiting its widespread
applicability. In constant, our method recovers the physical formation of RS
images by estimating camera poses and velocities, thereby removing the input
constraints on sequential data. Moreover, we adopt a coarse-to-fine training
strategy, in which the RS epipolar constraints of the pairwise frames in the
scene graph are used to detect the camera poses that fall into local minima.
The poses detected as outliers are corrected by the interpolation method with
neighboring poses. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
method over state-of-the-art works and demonstrate that the reconstruction of
3D representations is not constrained by the requirement of video sequence
input.

                                        <span>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noise. A range of
adversarial defense techniques have been proposed to mitigate the interference
of adversarial noise, among which the input pre-processing methods are scalable
and show great potential to safeguard DNNs. However, pre-processing methods may
suffer from the robustness degradation effect, in which the defense reduces
rather than improving the adversarial robustness of a target model in a
white-box setting. A potential cause of this negative effect is that
adversarial training examples are static and independent to the pre-processing
model. To solve this problem, we investigate the influence of full adversarial
examples which are crafted against the full model, and find they indeed have a
positive impact on the robustness of defenses. Furthermore, we find that simply
changing the adversarial training examples in pre-processing methods does not
completely alleviate the robustness degradation effect. This is due to the
adversarial risk of the pre-processed model being neglected, which is another
cause of the robustness degradation effect. Motivated by above analyses, we
propose a method called Joint Adversarial Training based Pre-processing (JATP)
defense. Specifically, we formulate a feature similarity based adversarial risk
for the pre-processing model by using full adversarial examples found in a
feature space. Unlike standard adversarial training, we only update the
pre-processing model, which prompts us to introduce a pixel-wise loss to
improve its cross-model transferability. We then conduct a joint adversarial
training on the pre-processing model to minimize this overall risk. Empirical
results show that our method could effectively mitigate the robustness
degradation effect across different target models in comparison to previous
state-of-the-art approaches.

                                        <span>  Generative models with discrete latent representations have recently
demonstrated an impressive ability to learn complex high-dimensional data
distributions. However, their performance relies on a long sequence of tokens
per instance and a large number of codebook entries, resulting in long sampling
times and considerable computation to fit the categorical posterior. To address
these issues, we propose the Masked Vector Quantization (MVQ) framework which
increases the representational capacity of each code vector by learning mask
configurations via a stochastic winner-takes-all training regime called
Multiple Hypothese Dropout (MH-Dropout). On ImageNet 64$\times$64, MVQ reduces
FID in existing vector quantization architectures by up to $68\%$ at 2 tokens
per instance and $57\%$ at 5 tokens. These improvements widen as codebook
entries is reduced and allows for $7\textit{--}45\times$ speed-up in token
sampling during inference. As an additional benefit, we find that smaller
latent spaces lead to MVQ identifying transferable visual representations where
multiple can be smoothly combined.

dynamic range compressors for digital audio production by analyzing their
analog prototypes. While realistic digital dynamic compressors are potentially
useful for many applications, the design process is challenging because the
compressors operate nonlinearly over long time scales. Our approach is based on
the structured state space sequence model (S4), as implementing the state-space
model (SSM) has proven to be efficient at learning long-range dependencies and
is promising for modeling dynamic range compressors. We present in this paper a
deep learning model with S4 layers to model the Teletronix LA-2A analog dynamic
range compressor. The model is causal, executes efficiently in real time, and
achieves roughly the same quality as previous deep-learning models but with
fewer parameters.

                                        <span>  Audio-visual target speech extraction (AV-TSE) is one of the enabling
technologies in robotics and many audio-visual applications. One of the
challenges of AV-TSE is how to effectively utilize audio-visual synchronization
information in the process. AV-HuBERT can be a useful pre-trained model for
lip-reading, which has not been adopted by AV-TSE. In this paper, we would like
to explore the way to integrate a pre-trained AV-HuBERT into our AV-TSE system.
We have good reasons to expect an improved performance. To benefit from the
inter and intra-modality correlations, we also propose a novel Mask-And-Recover
(MAR) strategy for self-supervised learning. The experimental results on the
VoxCeleb2 dataset show that our proposed model outperforms the baselines both
in terms of subjective and objective metrics, suggesting that the pre-trained
AV-HuBERT model provides more informative visual cues for target speech
extraction. Furthermore, through a comparative study, we confirm that the
proposed Mask-And-Recover strategy is significantly effective.

different types of microphone array designs. 1-D (linear) and 2-D (planar)
microphone array types are considered, and the delay and sum beamforming and
conventional beamforming techniques are employed to localize the sound source.
A non-dimensional parameter, G, is characterized to simplify and standardize
the rejection performance of both 1-D and 2-D microphone arrays as a function
of array geometry and sound source parameters. This parameter G is then used to
determine an improved design of a 2-D microphone array for far-field sound
localization. One such design, termed the Equi-area array is introduced and
analyzed in detail. The design is shown to have an advantageous rejection
performance compared to other conventionally used 2-D planar microphone arrays.

                                        <span>  Recently, progress in acquisition equipment such as LiDAR sensors has enabled
sensing increasingly spacious outdoor 3D environments. Making sense of such 3D
acquisitions requires fine-grained scene understanding, such as constructing
instance-based 3D scene segmentations. Commonly, a neural network is trained
for this task; however, this requires access to a large, densely annotated
dataset, which is widely known to be challenging to obtain. To address this
issue, in this work we propose to predict instance segmentations for 3D scenes
in an unsupervised way, without relying on ground-truth annotations. To this
end, we construct a learning framework consisting of two components: (1) a
pseudo-annotation scheme for generating initial unsupervised pseudo-labels; and
(2) a self-training algorithm for instance segmentation to fit robust, accurate
instances from initial noisy proposals. To enable generating 3D instance mask
proposals, we construct a weighted proxy-graph by connecting 3D points with
edges integrating multi-modal image- and point-based self-supervised features,
and perform graph-cuts to isolate individual pseudo-instances. We then build on
a state-of-the-art point-based architecture and train a 3D instance
segmentation model, resulting in significant refinement of initial proposals.
To scale to arbitrary complexity 3D scenes, we design our algorithm to operate
on local 3D point chunks and construct a merging step to generate scene-level
instance segmentations. Experiments on the challenging SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate the potential of our approach, where it attains 13.3% higher
Average Precision and 9.1% higher F1 score compared to the best-performing
baseline. The code will be made publicly available at

                                        <span>  We present latentSplat, a method to predict semantic Gaussians in a 3D latent
space that can be splatted and decoded by a light-weight generative 2D
architecture. Existing methods for generalizable 3D reconstruction either do
not enable fast inference of high resolution novel views due to slow volume
rendering, or are limited to interpolation of close input views, even in
simpler settings with a single central object, where 360-degree generalization
is possible. In this work, we combine a regression-based approach with a
generative model, moving towards both of these capabilities within the same
method, trained purely on readily available real video data. The core of our
method are variational 3D Gaussians, a representation that efficiently encodes
varying uncertainty within a latent space consisting of 3D feature Gaussians.
From these Gaussians, specific instances can be sampled and rendered via
efficient Gaussian splatting and a fast, generative decoder network. We show
that latentSplat outperforms previous works in reconstruction quality and
generalization, while being fast and scalable to high-resolution data.

adapt to the visual interference that results from blood rapidly filling the
surgical field. Introducing automation into the crucial surgical task of
hemostasis management would offload mental and physical tasks from the surgeon
and surgical assistants while simultaneously increasing the efficiency and
safety of the operation. The first step in automation of hemostasis management
is detection of blood in the surgical field. To propel the development of blood
detection algorithms in surgeries, we present HemoSet, the first blood
segmentation dataset based on bleeding during a live animal robotic surgery.
Our dataset features vessel hemorrhage scenarios where turbulent flow leads to
abnormal pooling geometries in surgical fields. These pools are formed in
conditions endemic to surgical procedures -- uneven heterogeneous tissue, under
glossy lighting conditions and rapid tool movement. We benchmark several
state-of-the-art segmentation models and provide insight into the difficulties
specific to blood detection. We intend for HemoSet to spur development of
autonomous blood suction tools by providing a platform for training and
refining blood segmentation models, addressing the precision needed for such
robotics.

                                        <span>  In everyday communication, humans frequently use speech and gestures to refer
to specific areas or objects, a process known as Referential Dialogue (RD).
While prior studies have investigated RD through Large Language Models (LLMs)
or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in static contexts, the exploration of
Temporal Referential Dialogue (TRD) within audio-visual media remains limited.
Two primary challenges hinder progress in this field: (1) the absence of
comprehensive, untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal
annotations, and (2) the need for methods to integrate complex temporal
auditory and visual cues effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel framework to generate PU-VALOR, an extensive audio-visual dataset
comprising over 114,000 untrimmed videos with accurate temporal demarcations.
We also present AVicuna, featuring an Audio-Visual Tokens Interleaver (AVTI)
that ensures the temporal alignment of audio-visual information. Additionally,
we develop the A5-222K dataset, encompassing more than 200,000 audio-text
pairings, to facilitate the audio and text alignments. Our experiments
demonstrate that AVicuna can effectively handle TRD in audio-visual videos and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on various audio-visual video
understanding tasks, particularly in untrimmed videos. We further investigate
the optimal audio-interleaving rate for interleaved audio-visual inputs, which
maximizes performance on the Audio-Visual Event Dense Localization task.

to be effective pretext tasks for many downstream tasks in computer vision. Due
to the significant disparity between medical and natural images, the
application of typical SSL is not straightforward in medical imaging.
Additionally, those pretext tasks often lack context, which is critical for
computer-aided clinical decision support. In this paper, we developed a
longitudinal masked auto-encoder (MAE) based on the well-known
Transformer-based MAE. In particular, we explored the importance of time-aware
position embedding as well as disease progression-aware masking. Taking into
account the time between examinations instead of just scheduling them offers
the benefit of capturing temporal changes and trends. The masking strategy, for
its part, evolves during follow-up to better capture pathological changes,
ensuring a more accurate assessment of disease progression. Using OPHDIAT, a
large follow-up screening dataset targeting diabetic retinopathy (DR), we
evaluated the pre-trained weights on a longitudinal task, which is to predict
the severity label of the next visit within 3 years based on the past time
series examinations. Our results demonstrated the relevancy of both time-aware
position embedding and masking strategies based on disease progression
knowledge. Compared to popular baseline models and standard longitudinal
Transformers, these simple yet effective extensions significantly enhance the
predictive ability of deep classification models.

have shown practical usability in closed set scenarios. However, for real-world
tasks, object detectors often operate in open environments, where crucial
factors (\eg, data distribution, objective) that influence model learning are
often changing. The dynamic and intricate nature of the open environment poses
novel and formidable challenges to object detectors. Unfortunately, current
research on object detectors in open environments lacks a comprehensive
analysis of their distinctive characteristics, challenges, and corresponding
solutions, which hinders their secure deployment in critical real-world
scenarios. This paper aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive
review and analysis of object detectors in open environments. We initially
identified limitations of key structural components within the existing
detection pipeline and propose the open environment object detector challenge
framework that includes four quadrants (\ie, out-of-domain, out-of-category,
robust learning, and incremental learning) based on the dimensions of the data
/ target changes. For each quadrant of challenges in the proposed framework, we
present a detailed description and systematic analysis of the overarching goals
and core difficulties, systematically review the corresponding solutions, and
benchmark their performance over multiple widely adopted datasets. In addition,
we engage in a discussion of open problems and potential avenues for future
research. This paper aims to provide a fresh, comprehensive, and systematic
understanding of the challenges and solutions associated with open-environment
object detectors, thus catalyzing the development of more solid applications in
real-world scenarios.

                                        <span>  In order to devise an anomaly detection model using only normal training
data, an autoencoder (AE) is typically trained to reconstruct the data. As a
result, the AE can extract normal representations in its latent space. During
test time, since AE is not trained using real anomalies, it is expected to
poorly reconstruct the anomalous data. However, several researchers have
observed that it is not the case. In this work, we propose to limit the
reconstruction capability of AE by introducing a novel latent constriction
loss, which is added to the existing reconstruction loss. By using our method,
no extra computational cost is added to the AE during test time. Evaluations
using three video anomaly detection benchmark datasets, i.e., Ped2, Avenue, and
ShanghaiTech, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in limiting the
reconstruction capability of AE, which leads to a better anomaly detection
model.

several domains such as medicine, driver fatigue surveillance, social robotics,
and human-computer interaction. Appraising human emotional states, behaviors,
and reactions displayed in real-world settings can be accomplished using latent
continuous dimensions. Continuous dimensional models of human affect, such as
those based on valence and arousal are more accurate in describing a broad
range of spontaneous everyday emotions than more traditional models of discrete
stereotypical emotion categories (e.g. happiness, surprise). Most of the prior
work on estimating valence and arousal considers laboratory settings and acted
data. But, for emotion recognition systems to be deployed and integrated into
real-world mobile and computing devices, we need to consider data collected in
the world. Action recognition is a domain of Computer Vision that involves
capturing complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion
between frames. In this paper, we treat emotion recognition from the
perspective of action recognition by exploring the application of deep learning
architectures specifically designed for action recognition, for continuous
affect recognition. We propose a novel three-stream end-to-end deep learning
regression pipeline with an attention mechanism, which is an ensemble design
based on sub-modules of multiple state-of-the-art action recognition systems.
The pipeline constitutes a novel data pre-processing approach with a spatial
self-attention mechanism to extract keyframes. The optical flow of
high-attention regions of the face is extracted to capture temporal context.
AFEW-VA in-the-wild dataset has been used to conduct comparative experiments.
Quantitative analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms multiple
standard baselines of both emotion recognition and action recognition models.

                                        <span>  Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD
detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a
prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing
on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model
ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and
the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble
methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are
affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to
achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model
ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight
initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This
innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages
diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and
labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC
Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble
method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to
detect instances outside its training distribution.

the perceptual quality of reconstructions in neural image compression, their
lack of inductive bias for image data restricts their ability to achieve
state-of-the-art perceptual levels. To address this limitation, we adopt a
non-isotropic diffusion model at the decoder side. This model imposes an
inductive bias aimed at distinguishing between frequency contents, thereby
facilitating the generation of high-quality images. Moreover, our framework is
equipped with a novel entropy model that accurately models the probability
distribution of latent representation by exploiting spatio-channel correlations
in latent space, while accelerating the entropy decoding step. This
channel-wise entropy model leverages both local and global spatial contexts
within each channel chunk. The global spatial context is built upon the
Transformer, which is specifically designed for image compression tasks. The
designed Transformer employs a Laplacian-shaped positional encoding, the
learnable parameters of which are adaptively adjusted for each channel cluster.
Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework yields better
perceptual quality compared to cutting-edge generative-based codecs, and the
proposed entropy model contributes to notable bitrate savings.

building high-quality features using the complementary strengths of various
data modalities. However, the open nature of such systems inadvertently
increases the possibility of backdoor attacks. These attacks subtly embed
malicious behaviors within the model during training, which can be activated by
specific triggers in the inference phase, posing significant security risks.
Despite existing countermeasures through fine-tuning that reduce the adverse
impacts of such attacks, these defenses often degrade the clean accuracy and
necessitate the construction of extensive clean training pairs. In this paper,
we explore the possibility of a less-cost defense from the perspective of model
unlearning, that is, whether the model can be made to quickly \textbf{u}nlearn
\textbf{b}ackdoor \textbf{t}hreats (UBT) by constructing a small set of
poisoned samples. Specifically, we strengthen the backdoor shortcuts to
discover suspicious samples through overfitting training prioritized by weak
similarity samples. Building on the initial identification of suspicious
samples, we introduce an innovative token-based localized forgetting training
regime. This technique specifically targets the poisoned aspects of the model,
applying a focused effort to unlearn the backdoor associations and trying not
to damage the integrity of the overall model. Experimental results show that
our method not only ensures a minimal success rate for attacks, but also
preserves the model's high clean accuracy.

and safety, machine learning models must systematically eliminate information
derived from specific subsets of a user's training data that can no longer be
utilized. The emerging discipline of Machine Unlearning has arisen as a pivotal
area of research, facilitating the process of selectively discarding
information designated to specific sets or classes of data from a pre-trained
model, thereby eliminating the necessity for extensive retraining from scratch.
The principal aim of this study is to formulate a methodology tailored for the
purposeful elimination of information linked to a specific class of data from a
pre-trained classification network. This intentional removal is crafted to
degrade the model's performance specifically concerning the unlearned data
class while concurrently minimizing any detrimental impacts on the model's
performance in other classes. To achieve this goal, we frame the class
unlearning problem from a Bayesian perspective, which yields a loss function
that minimizes the log-likelihood associated with the unlearned data with a
stability regularization in parameter space. This stability regularization
incorporates Mohalanobis distance with respect to the Fisher Information matrix
and $l_2$ distance from the pre-trained model parameters. Our novel approach,
termed \textbf{Partially-Blinded Unlearning (PBU)}, surpasses existing
state-of-the-art class unlearning methods, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. Notably, PBU achieves this efficacy without requiring awareness
of the entire training dataset but only to the unlearned data points, marking a
distinctive feature of its performance.

the equivalency of synthetic data to real-world data, the substitutability of
synthetic data for real data, and the flexibility of synthetic data generators
to close up domain gaps. Leveraging the M3Act synthetic data generator, we
conduct experiments on DanceTrack and MOT17. Our results suggest that synthetic
data not only enhances model performance but also demonstrates substitutability
for real data, with 60% to 80% replacement without performance loss. In
addition, our study of the impact of synthetic data distributions on downstream
performance reveals the importance of flexible data generators in narrowing
domain gaps for improved model adaptability.

                                        <span>  The creation of photorealistic virtual worlds requires the accurate modeling
of 3D surface geometry for a wide range of objects. For this, meshes are
appealing since they 1) enable fast physics-based rendering with realistic
material and lighting, 2) support physical simulation, and 3) are
memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing
and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being
topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D
representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin,
open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for
reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material
and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation
that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we
parameterize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on
watertight templates. With this parameterization, we further develop a
grid-based and differentiable representation that parameterizes both watertight
and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called
Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications:
differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and
generative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that
G-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh
reconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for
watertight meshes.

forefront of video analytics are video queries that users develop to find
objects of particular interest. Building upon the insight that video objects
(e.g., human, animals, cars, etc.), the center of video analytics, are similar
in spirit to objects modeled by traditional object-oriented languages, we
propose to develop an object-oriented approach to video analytics. This
approach, named VQPy, consists of a frontend$\unicode{x2015}$a Python variant
with constructs that make it easy for users to express video objects and their
interactions$\unicode{x2015}$as well as an extensible backend that can
automatically construct and optimize pipelines based on video objects. We have
implemented and open-sourced VQPy, which has been productized in Cisco as part

                                        <span>  The efficacy of machine learning has traditionally relied on the availability
of increasingly larger datasets. However, large datasets pose storage
challenges and contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during
training without impacting the final accuracy of the model. In response to
these limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into
a condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged.
One crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking
the original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if
the employed model architecture differs from the model used during
distillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images,
e.g., 128x128 and higher. In this paper, we propose Latent Dataset Distillation
with Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with
dataset distillation to tackle both challenges. LD3M incorporates a novel
diffusion process tailored for dataset distillation, which improves the
gradient norms for learning synthetic images. By adjusting the number of
diffusion steps, LD3M also offers a straightforward way of controlling the
trade-off between speed and accuracy. We evaluate our approach in several
ImageNet subsets and for high-resolution images (128x128 and 256x256). As a
result, LD3M consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation techniques
by up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2 p.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively.

synthesis can achieve impressive results on curated benchmarks; however, images
captured in real life are often blurry. In this work, we analyze the robustness
of Gaussian-Splatting-based methods against various image blur, such as motion
blur, defocus blur, downscaling blur, \etc. Under these degradations,
Gaussian-Splatting-based methods tend to overfit and produce worse results than
Neural-Radiance-Field-based methods. To address this issue, we propose Blur
Agnostic Gaussian Splatting (BAGS). BAGS introduces additional 2D modeling
capacities such that a 3D-consistent and high quality scene can be
reconstructed despite image-wise blur. Specifically, we model blur by
estimating per-pixel convolution kernels from a Blur Proposal Network (BPN).
BPN is designed to consider spatial, color, and depth variations of the scene
to maximize modeling capacity. Additionally, BPN also proposes a
quality-assessing mask, which indicates regions where blur occur. Finally, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine kernel optimization scheme; this optimization scheme
is fast and avoids sub-optimal solutions due to a sparse point cloud
initialization, which often occurs when we apply Structure-from-Motion on
blurry images. We demonstrate that BAGS achieves photorealistic renderings
under various challenging blur conditions and imaging geometry, while
significantly improving upon existing approaches.

dataset of a deep neural network, the network can be induced to exhibit
malicious behavior during inferences, which poses potential threats to
real-world applications. While they have been intensively studied in
classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely
overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every
pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on
segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a
specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed
Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the
classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and mislead classifications of all
victim pixels in every single inference and could be easily applied to
real-world scenes. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation
models, we proposed a simple, yet effective, Nearest-Neighbor trigger injection
strategy. We also introduce an innovative Pixel Random Labeling strategy which
maintains optimal performance even when the trigger is placed far from the
victim pixels. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation
models do suffer from backdoor attacks, demonstrate IBA real-world
applicability, and show that our proposed techniques can further increase
attack performance.

                                        <span>  Radiance fields have demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing
novel views from sparse input views, yet prevailing methods suffer from high
training costs and slow inference speed. This paper introduces DNGaussian, a
depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields, offering
real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our
motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising
quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting, despite it will encounter a
geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance
fields, we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the
positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint.
Consequently, we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore
accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while
maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed
geometry reshaping, we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization, enhancing
the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF, DTU, and
Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced
memory cost, a $25 \times$ reduction in training time, and over $3000 \times$
faster rendering speed.

without requiring visual descriptors has garnered increased interest due to its
low memory requirements, inherent privacy preservation, and reduced need for
expensive 3D model maintenance compared to visual descriptor-based methods.
However, existing algorithms often compromise on performance, resulting in a
significant deterioration compared to their descriptor-based counterparts. In
this paper, we introduce DGC-GNN, a novel algorithm that employs a
global-to-local Graph Neural Network (GNN) that progressively exploits
geometric and color cues to represent keypoints, thereby improving matching
accuracy. Our procedure encodes both Euclidean and angular relations at a
coarse level, forming the geometric embedding to guide the point matching. We
evaluate DGC-GNN on both indoor and outdoor datasets, demonstrating that it not
only doubles the accuracy of the state-of-the-art visual descriptor-free
algorithm but also substantially narrows the performance gap between
descriptor-based and descriptor-free methods.

                                        <span>  Object rearrangement is pivotal in robotic-environment interactions,
representing a significant capability in embodied AI. In this paper, we present
SG-Bot, a novel rearrangement framework that utilizes a coarse-to-fine scheme
with a scene graph as the scene representation. Unlike previous methods that
rely on either known goal priors or zero-shot large models, SG-Bot exemplifies
lightweight, real-time, and user-controllable characteristics, seamlessly
blending the consideration of commonsense knowledge with automatic generation
capabilities. SG-Bot employs a three-fold procedure--observation, imagination,
and execution--to adeptly address the task. Initially, objects are discerned
and extracted from a cluttered scene during the observation. These objects are
first coarsely organized and depicted within a scene graph, guided by either
commonsense or user-defined criteria. Then, this scene graph subsequently
informs a generative model, which forms a fine-grained goal scene considering
the shape information from the initial scene and object semantics. Finally, for
execution, the initial and envisioned goal scenes are matched to formulate
robotic action policies. Experimental results demonstrate that SG-Bot
outperforms competitors by a large margin.

useful for many applications, the design process is challenging because the
compressors operate nonlinearly over long time scales. Our approach is based on
the structured state space sequence model (S4), as implementing the state-space
model (SSM) has proven to be efficient at learning long-range dependencies and
is promising for modeling dynamic range compressors. We present in this paper a
deep learning model with S4 layers to model the Teletronix LA-2A analog dynamic
range compressor. The model is causal, executes efficiently in real time, and
achieves roughly the same quality as previous deep-learning models but with
fewer parameters.

different types of microphone array designs. 1-D (linear) and 2-D (planar)
microphone array types are considered, and the delay and sum beamforming and
conventional beamforming techniques are employed to localize the sound source.
A non-dimensional parameter, G, is characterized to simplify and standardize
the rejection performance of both 1-D and 2-D microphone arrays as a function
of array geometry and sound source parameters. This parameter G is then used to
determine an improved design of a 2-D microphone array for far-field sound
localization. One such design, termed the Equi-area array is introduced and
analyzed in detail. The design is shown to have an advantageous rejection
performance compared to other conventionally used 2-D planar microphone arrays.

                                        <span>  Audio-visual target speech extraction (AV-TSE) is one of the enabling
technologies in robotics and many audio-visual applications. One of the
challenges of AV-TSE is how to effectively utilize audio-visual synchronization
information in the process. AV-HuBERT can be a useful pre-trained model for
lip-reading, which has not been adopted by AV-TSE. In this paper, we would like
to explore the way to integrate a pre-trained AV-HuBERT into our AV-TSE system.
We have good reasons to expect an improved performance. To benefit from the
inter and intra-modality correlations, we also propose a novel Mask-And-Recover
(MAR) strategy for self-supervised learning. The experimental results on the
VoxCeleb2 dataset show that our proposed model outperforms the baselines both
in terms of subjective and objective metrics, suggesting that the pre-trained
AV-HuBERT model provides more informative visual cues for target speech
extraction. Furthermore, through a comparative study, we confirm that the
proposed Mask-And-Recover strategy is significantly effective.

signal analysis methods were then validated by testing their performance on a
replayed speech detection benchmark (i.e., the ASVspoof 2019 Physical Access)

reported systems were shown by the experimental results with three signal

We introduce MDLT, a novel approach that frames the choreography generation
problem as a translation task. Our method leverages an existing data set to
learn to translate sequences of audio into corresponding dance poses. We
present two variants of MDLT: one utilising the Transformer architecture and
the other employing the Mamba architecture. We train our method on AIST++ and
PhantomDance data sets to teach a robotic arm to dance, but our method can be
applied to a full humanoid robot. Evaluation metrics, including Average Joint
Error and Frechet Inception Distance, consistently demonstrate that, when given
a piece of music, MDLT excels at producing realistic and high-quality
choreography. The code can be found at github.com/meowatthemoon/MDLT.

attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for
neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study
makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which
evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in
the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch
speech stimuli that were amplitude modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random
noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We
compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various
modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to
decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the
conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to
unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these
results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating
noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple
speakers are presented simultaneously.

                                        <span>  A key challenge in machine learning is to generalize from training data to an
application domain of interest. This work generalizes the recently-proposed
mixture invariant training (MixIT) algorithm to perform unsupervised learning
in the multi-channel setting. We use MixIT to train a model on far-field
microphone array recordings of overlapping reverberant and noisy speech from
the AMI Corpus. The models are trained on both supervised and unsupervised
training data, and are tested on real AMI recordings containing overlapping
speech. To objectively evaluate our models, we also use a synthetic
multi-channel AMI test set. Holding network architectures constant, we find
that a fine-tuned semi-supervised model yields the largest improvement to
SI-SNR and to human listening ratings across synthetic and real datasets,
outperforming supervised models trained on well-matched synthetic data. Our
results demonstrate that unsupervised learning through MixIT enables model
adaptation on both single- and multi-channel real-world speech recordings.

generalizing to unseen tasks when provided with well-formulated instructions.
However, existing studies in speech processing primarily focus on limited or
specific tasks. Moreover, the lack of standardized benchmarks hinders a fair
comparison across different approaches. Thus, we present Dynamic-SUPERB, a
benchmark designed for building universal speech models capable of leveraging
instruction tuning to perform multiple tasks in a zero-shot fashion. To achieve
comprehensive coverage of diverse speech tasks and harness instruction tuning,
we invite the community to collaborate and contribute, facilitating the dynamic
growth of the benchmark. To initiate, Dynamic-SUPERB features 55 evaluation
instances by combining 33 tasks and 22 datasets. This spans a broad spectrum of
dimensions, providing a comprehensive platform for evaluation. Additionally, we
propose several approaches to establish benchmark baselines. These include the
utilization of speech models, text language models, and the multimodal encoder.
Evaluation results indicate that while these baselines perform reasonably on
seen tasks, they struggle with unseen ones. We release all materials to the
public and welcome researchers to collaborate on the project, advancing
technologies in the field together.

                                        <span>  Despite notable progress, speech emotion recognition (SER) remains
challenging due to the intricate and ambiguous nature of speech emotion,
particularly in wild world. While current studies primarily focus on
recognition and generalization abilities, our research pioneers an
investigation into the reliability of SER methods in the presence of semantic
data shifts and explores how to exert fine-grained control over various
attributes inherent in speech signals to enhance speech emotion modeling. In
this paper, we first introduce MSAC-SERNet, a novel unified SER framework
capable of simultaneously handling both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER.
Specifically, concentrating exclusively on the speech emotion attribute, a
novel CNN-based SER model is presented to extract discriminative emotional
representations, guided by additive margin softmax loss. Considering
information overlap between various speech attributes, we propose a novel
learning paradigm based on correlations of different speech attributes, termed
Multiple Speech Attribute Control (MSAC), which empowers the proposed SER model
to simultaneously capture fine-grained emotion-related features while
mitigating the negative impact of emotion-agnostic representations.
Furthermore, we make a first attempt to examine the reliability of the
MSAC-SERNet framework using out-of-distribution detection methods. Experiments
on both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER scenarios indicate that MSAC-SERNet
not only consistently outperforms the baseline in all aspects, but achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art SER approaches.

                                        <span>  Many hearables contain an in-ear microphone, which may be used to capture the
own voice of its user. However, due to the hearable occluding the ear canal,
the in-ear microphone mostly records body-conducted speech, typically suffering
from band-limitation effects and amplification at low frequencies. Since the
occlusion effect is determined by the ratio between the air-conducted and
body-conducted components of own voice, the own voice transfer characteristics
between the outer face of the hearable and the in-ear microphone depend on the
speech content and the individual talker. In this paper, we propose a
speech-dependent model of the own voice transfer characteristics based on
phoneme recognition, assuming a linear time-invariant relative transfer
function for each phoneme. We consider both individual models as well as models
averaged over several talkers. Experimental results based on recordings with a
prototype hearable show that the proposed speech-dependent model enables to
simulate in-ear signals more accurately than a speech-independent model in
terms of technical measures, especially under utterance mismatch and talker
mismatch. Additionally, simulation results show that talker-averaged models
generalize better to different talkers than individual models.

                                        <span>  Audio-visual approaches involving visual inputs have laid the foundation for
recent progress in speech separation. However, the optimization of the
concurrent usage of auditory and visual inputs is still an active research
area. Inspired by the cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit, in which the sensory
processing mechanisms of different modalities modulate one another via the
non-lemniscal sensory thalamus, we propose a novel cortico-thalamo-cortical
neural network (CTCNet) for audio-visual speech separation (AVSS). First, the
CTCNet learns hierarchical auditory and visual representations in a bottom-up
manner in separate auditory and visual subnetworks, mimicking the functions of
the auditory and visual cortical areas. Then, inspired by the large number of
connections between cortical regions and the thalamus, the model fuses the
auditory and visual information in a thalamic subnetwork through top-down
connections. Finally, the model transmits this fused information back to the
auditory and visual subnetworks, and the above process is repeated several
times. The results of experiments on three speech separation benchmark datasets
show that CTCNet remarkably outperforms existing AVSS methods with considerably
fewer parameters. These results suggest that mimicking the anatomical
connectome of the mammalian brain has great potential for advancing the
development of deep neural networks. Project repo is

audibility or speech intelligibility. A variety of evolving factors related to
technological advances, cinema production and social behaviour challenge our
perception and understanding. This study seeks to formalise and give context to
these influential factors under a wider and novel term referred to as Dialogue
Understandability. We propose a working definition for Dialogue
Understandability being a listener's capacity to follow the story without undue
cognitive effort or concentration being required that impacts their Quality of
Experience (QoE). The paper identifies, describes and categorises the factors
that influence Dialogue Understandability mapping them over the QoE framework,
a media streaming lifecycle, and the stakeholders involved. We then explore
available measurement tools in the literature and link them to the factors they
could potentially be used for. The maturity and suitability of these tools is
evaluated over a set of pilot experiments. Finally, we reflect on the gaps that
still need to be filled, what we can measure and what not, future subjective
experiments, and new research trends that could help us to fully characterise
Dialogue Understandability.

We introduce MDLT, a novel approach that frames the choreography generation
problem as a translation task. Our method leverages an existing data set to
learn to translate sequences of audio into corresponding dance poses. We
present two variants of MDLT: one utilising the Transformer architecture and
the other employing the Mamba architecture. We train our method on AIST++ and
PhantomDance data sets to teach a robotic arm to dance, but our method can be
applied to a full humanoid robot. Evaluation metrics, including Average Joint
Error and Frechet Inception Distance, consistently demonstrate that, when given
a piece of music, MDLT excels at producing realistic and high-quality
choreography. The code can be found at github.com/meowatthemoon/MDLT.

                                        <span>  Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to extract from brain activity the
attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for
neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study
makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which
evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in
the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch
speech stimuli that were amplitude modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random
noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We
compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various
modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to
decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the
conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to
unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these
results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating
noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple
speakers are presented simultaneously.

                                        <span>  Spoken language understanding (SLU), one of the key enabling technologies for
human-computer interaction in IoT devices, provides an easy-to-use user
interface. Human speech can contain a lot of user-sensitive information, such
as gender, identity, and sensitive content. New types of security and privacy
breaches have thus emerged. Users do not want to expose their personal
sensitive information to malicious attacks by untrusted third parties. Thus,
the SLU system needs to ensure that a potential malicious attacker cannot
deduce the sensitive attributes of the users, while it should avoid greatly
compromising the SLU accuracy. To address the above challenge, this paper
proposes a novel SLU multi-task privacy-preserving model to prevent both the
speech recognition (ASR) and identity recognition (IR) attacks. The model uses
the hidden layer separation technique so that SLU information is distributed
only in a specific portion of the hidden layer, and the other two types of
information are removed to obtain a privacy-secure hidden layer. In order to
achieve good balance between efficiency and privacy, we introduce a new
mechanism of model pre-training, namely joint adversarial training, to further
enhance the user privacy. Experiments over two SLU datasets show that the
proposed method can reduce the accuracy of both the ASR and IR attacks close to
that of a random guess, while leaving the SLU performance largely unaffected.

application domain of interest. This work generalizes the recently-proposed
mixture invariant training (MixIT) algorithm to perform unsupervised learning
in the multi-channel setting. We use MixIT to train a model on far-field
microphone array recordings of overlapping reverberant and noisy speech from
the AMI Corpus. The models are trained on both supervised and unsupervised
training data, and are tested on real AMI recordings containing overlapping
speech. To objectively evaluate our models, we also use a synthetic
multi-channel AMI test set. Holding network architectures constant, we find
that a fine-tuned semi-supervised model yields the largest improvement to
SI-SNR and to human listening ratings across synthetic and real datasets,
outperforming supervised models trained on well-matched synthetic data. Our
results demonstrate that unsupervised learning through MixIT enables model
adaptation on both single- and multi-channel real-world speech recordings.

generalizing to unseen tasks when provided with well-formulated instructions.
However, existing studies in speech processing primarily focus on limited or
specific tasks. Moreover, the lack of standardized benchmarks hinders a fair
comparison across different approaches. Thus, we present Dynamic-SUPERB, a
benchmark designed for building universal speech models capable of leveraging
instruction tuning to perform multiple tasks in a zero-shot fashion. To achieve
comprehensive coverage of diverse speech tasks and harness instruction tuning,
we invite the community to collaborate and contribute, facilitating the dynamic
growth of the benchmark. To initiate, Dynamic-SUPERB features 55 evaluation
instances by combining 33 tasks and 22 datasets. This spans a broad spectrum of
dimensions, providing a comprehensive platform for evaluation. Additionally, we
propose several approaches to establish benchmark baselines. These include the
utilization of speech models, text language models, and the multimodal encoder.
Evaluation results indicate that while these baselines perform reasonably on
seen tasks, they struggle with unseen ones. We release all materials to the
public and welcome researchers to collaborate on the project, advancing
technologies in the field together.

                                        <span>  Despite notable progress, speech emotion recognition (SER) remains
challenging due to the intricate and ambiguous nature of speech emotion,
particularly in wild world. While current studies primarily focus on
recognition and generalization abilities, our research pioneers an
investigation into the reliability of SER methods in the presence of semantic
data shifts and explores how to exert fine-grained control over various
attributes inherent in speech signals to enhance speech emotion modeling. In
this paper, we first introduce MSAC-SERNet, a novel unified SER framework
capable of simultaneously handling both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER.
Specifically, concentrating exclusively on the speech emotion attribute, a
novel CNN-based SER model is presented to extract discriminative emotional
representations, guided by additive margin softmax loss. Considering
information overlap between various speech attributes, we propose a novel
learning paradigm based on correlations of different speech attributes, termed
Multiple Speech Attribute Control (MSAC), which empowers the proposed SER model
to simultaneously capture fine-grained emotion-related features while
mitigating the negative impact of emotion-agnostic representations.
Furthermore, we make a first attempt to examine the reliability of the
MSAC-SERNet framework using out-of-distribution detection methods. Experiments
on both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER scenarios indicate that MSAC-SERNet
not only consistently outperforms the baseline in all aspects, but achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art SER approaches.

                                        <span>  Many hearables contain an in-ear microphone, which may be used to capture the
own voice of its user. However, due to the hearable occluding the ear canal,
the in-ear microphone mostly records body-conducted speech, typically suffering
from band-limitation effects and amplification at low frequencies. Since the
occlusion effect is determined by the ratio between the air-conducted and
body-conducted components of own voice, the own voice transfer characteristics
between the outer face of the hearable and the in-ear microphone depend on the
speech content and the individual talker. In this paper, we propose a
speech-dependent model of the own voice transfer characteristics based on
phoneme recognition, assuming a linear time-invariant relative transfer
function for each phoneme. We consider both individual models as well as models
averaged over several talkers. Experimental results based on recordings with a
prototype hearable show that the proposed speech-dependent model enables to
simulate in-ear signals more accurately than a speech-independent model in
terms of technical measures, especially under utterance mismatch and talker
mismatch. Additionally, simulation results show that talker-averaged models
generalize better to different talkers than individual models.

                                        <span>  Recently, there has been an increased interest in the practical problem of
learning multiple dense scene understanding tasks from partially annotated
data, where each training sample is only labeled for a subset of the tasks. The
missing of task labels in training leads to low-quality and noisy predictions,
as can be observed from state-of-the-art methods. To tackle this issue, we
reformulate the partially-labeled multi-task dense prediction as a pixel-level
denoising problem, and propose a novel multi-task denoising diffusion framework
coined as DiffusionMTL. It designs a joint diffusion and denoising paradigm to
model a potential noisy distribution in the task prediction or feature maps and
generate rectified outputs for different tasks. To exploit multi-task
consistency in denoising, we further introduce a Multi-Task Conditioning
strategy, which can implicitly utilize the complementary nature of the tasks to
help learn the unlabeled tasks, leading to an improvement in the denoising
performance of the different tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task denoising diffusion model
can significantly improve multi-task prediction maps, and outperform the
state-of-the-art methods on three challenging multi-task benchmarks, under two
different partial-labeling evaluation settings. The code is available at
https://prismformore.github.io/diffusionmtl/.

                                        <span>  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant reasoning capabilities
by connecting a visual encoder and a large language model. LMMs typically use a
fixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the
CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more
complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which
increase the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design
of the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these
models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To
tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar
to prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this,
we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which
largely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model
performance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their
similarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned
tokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned
tokens to supplement their information. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5,
our approach can compress the visual tokens by 14.4 times on average, and
achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and
reasoning tasks. Code and checkpoints are at https://llava-prumerge.github.io/.

require time-consuming optimization that can take up to an hour per prompt.
Amortized methods like ATT3D optimize multiple prompts simultaneously to
improve efficiency, enabling fast text-to-3D synthesis. However, they cannot
capture high-frequency geometry and texture details and struggle to scale to
large prompt sets, so they generalize poorly. We introduce LATTE3D, addressing
these limitations to achieve fast, high-quality generation on a significantly
larger prompt set. Key to our method is 1) building a scalable architecture and
2) leveraging 3D data during optimization through 3D-aware diffusion priors,
shape regularization, and model initialization to achieve robustness to diverse
and complex training prompts. LATTE3D amortizes both neural field and textured
surface generation to produce highly detailed textured meshes in a single
forward pass. LATTE3D generates 3D objects in 400ms, and can be further
enhanced with fast test-time optimization.

                                        <span>  Real-world applications often require a large gallery of 3D assets that share
a consistent theme. While remarkable advances have been made in general 3D
content creation from text or image, synthesizing customized 3D assets
following the shared theme of input 3D exemplars remains an open and
challenging problem. In this work, we present ThemeStation, a novel approach
for theme-aware 3D-to-3D generation. ThemeStation synthesizes customized 3D
assets based on given few exemplars with two goals: 1) unity for generating 3D
assets that thematically align with the given exemplars and 2) diversity for
generating 3D assets with a high degree of variations. To this end, we design a
two-stage framework that draws a concept image first, followed by a
reference-informed 3D modeling stage. We propose a novel dual score
distillation (DSD) loss to jointly leverage priors from both the input
exemplars and the synthesized concept image. Extensive experiments and user
studies confirm that ThemeStation surpasses prior works in producing diverse
theme-aware 3D models with impressive quality. ThemeStation also enables
various applications such as controllable 3D-to-3D generation.

                                        <span>  We introduce DragAPart, a method that, given an image and a set of drags as
input, can generate a new image of the same object in a new state, compatible
with the action of the drags. Differently from prior works that focused on
repositioning objects, DragAPart predicts part-level interactions, such as
opening and closing a drawer. We study this problem as a proxy for learning a
generalist motion model, not restricted to a specific kinematic structure or
object category. To this end, we start from a pre-trained image generator and
fine-tune it on a new synthetic dataset, Drag-a-Move, which we introduce.
Combined with a new encoding for the drags and dataset randomization, the new
model generalizes well to real images and different categories. Compared to
prior motion-controlled generators, we demonstrate much better part-level
motion understanding.

                                        <span>  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been the cornerstone for
zero-shot classification, text-image retrieval, and text-image generation by
aligning image and text modalities. Despite its widespread adoption, a
significant limitation of CLIP lies in the inadequate length of text input. The
length of the text token is restricted to 77, and an empirical study shows the
actual effective length is even less than 20. This prevents CLIP from handling
detailed descriptions, limiting its applications for image retrieval and
text-to-image generation with extensive prerequisites. To this end, we propose
Long-CLIP as a plug-and-play alternative to CLIP that supports long-text input,
retains or even surpasses its zero-shot generalizability, and aligns the CLIP
latent space, making it readily replace CLIP without any further adaptation in
downstream frameworks. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is far from
straightforward, as simplistic fine-tuning can result in a significant
degradation of CLIP's performance. Moreover, substituting the text encoder with
a language model supporting longer contexts necessitates pretraining with vast
amounts of data, incurring significant expenses. Accordingly, Long-CLIP
introduces an efficient fine-tuning solution on CLIP with two novel strategies
designed to maintain the original capabilities, including (1) a
knowledge-preserved stretching of positional embedding and (2) a primary
component matching of CLIP features. With leveraging just one million extra
long text-image pairs, Long-CLIP has shown the superiority to CLIP for about
20% in long caption text-image retrieval and 6% in traditional text-image
retrieval tasks, e.g., COCO and Flickr30k. Furthermore, Long-CLIP offers
enhanced capabilities for generating images from detailed text descriptions by
replacing CLIP in a plug-and-play manner.

video-centric dialogue. Our approach employs a progressive training paradigm
that unifies the different self- or weakly-supervised learning frameworks of
masked video token reconstruction, cross-modal contrastive learning, and next
token prediction. Different training stages would guide our model to capture
different levels of structure and semantic information through different
pretext tasks. At the data level, we prioritize the spatiotemporal consistency
by semantically segmenting videos and generating video-audio-speech captions.
This improves the alignment between video and text. We scale both data and
model size for our InternVideo2. Through extensive experiments, we validate our
designs and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on over 60 video and
audio tasks. Notably, our model outperforms others on various video-related
captioning, dialogue, and long video understanding benchmarks, highlighting its
ability to reason and comprehend long temporal contexts. Code and models are

essential for the effectiveness of autonomous driving systems. However, the
real-world data collected often lacks the necessary diversity presenting a
long-tail distribution. Although synthetic data has been utilized to overcome
this issue by generating virtual scenes, it faces hurdles such as a significant
domain gap and the substantial efforts required from 3D artists to create
realistic environments. To overcome these challenges, we present ARSim, a fully
automated, comprehensive, modular framework designed to enhance real multi-view
image data with 3D synthetic objects of interest. The proposed method
integrates domain adaptation and randomization strategies to address covariate
shift between real and simulated data by inferring essential domain attributes
from real data and employing simulation-based randomization for other
attributes. We construct a simplified virtual scene using real data and
strategically place 3D synthetic assets within it. Illumination is achieved by
estimating light distribution from multiple images capturing the surroundings
of the vehicle. Camera parameters from real data are employed to render
synthetic assets in each frame. The resulting augmented multi-view consistent
dataset is used to train a multi-camera perception network for autonomous
vehicles. Experimental results on various AV perception tasks demonstrate the
superior performance of networks trained on the augmented dataset.

delineation of complex fine-scaled structures such as neurons, tissues, and

power of deep learning methods, they do not provide a satisfactory

scalable annotation and downstream analysis. In this dissertation, we tackle
such challenges by proposing novel representations of these topological

MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs
across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention
networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning
input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo,
Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address
the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the
state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for
computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces
Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations
and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies
across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms
existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers.
Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet
and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as
task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets. The

interpret the Earth's surface using satellite observational data. Traditional
models have been siloed, tailored to specific sensors or data types like
optical, radar, and hyperspectral, each with its own unique characteristics.
This specialization hinders the potential for a holistic analysis that could
benefit from the combined strengths of these diverse data sources. Our novel
approach introduces the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, leveraging the
concept of neural plasticity in brain science to integrate various data
modalities into a single framework adaptively. This dynamic hypernetwork,
adjusting to different wavelengths, enables a single versatile Transformer
jointly trained on data from five sensors to excel across 12 distinct Earth
observation tasks, including sensors never seen during pretraining. DOFA's
innovative design offers a promising leap towards more accurate, efficient, and

                                        <span>  Arthroplasty is commonly performed to treat joint osteoarthritis, reducing
pain and improving mobility. While arthroplasty has known several technical
improvements, a significant share of patients are still unsatisfied with their
surgery. Personalised arthroplasty improves surgical outcomes however current
solutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical routine.
We propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific implants,
presented for total knee arthroplasty, the most widely performed arthroplasty
in the world nowadays.
  The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to segment the
proximal and distal extremities of the femur and tibia. Then the full bones are
reconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and
landmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to
design patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained using
91 CT scans of lower limb and evaluated on 41 CT scans manually segmented, in
terms of accuracy and execution time.
  The workflow accuracy was $0.4\pm0.2mm$ for the segmentation, $1.2\pm0.4mm$
for the full bones reconstruction, and $2.8\pm2.2mm$ for the anatomical
landmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with
$0.6\pm0.2mm$ accuracy. The whole process from segmentation to implants' design
lasted about 5 minutes.
  The proposed workflow allows for a fast and reliable personalisation of knee
implants, directly from the patient CT image without requiring any manual
intervention. It establishes a patient-specific pre-operative planning for TKA
in a very short time making it easily available for all patients. Combined with
efficient implant manufacturing techniques, this solution could help answer the
growing number of arthroplasties while reducing complications and improving the
patients' satisfaction.

tendency of generated images overfitting to the biases present in the reference
images. We initiate our study with a comprehensive categorization of the biases
into background, nearby-object, tied-object, substance (in style
re-contextualization), and pose biases. These biases manifest in the generated
images due to their entanglement into the subject embedding. This undesired
embedding entanglement not only results in the reflection of biases from the
reference images into the generated images but also notably diminishes the
alignment of the generated images with the given generation prompt. To address
this challenge, we propose SID~(Selectively Informative Description), a text
description strategy that deviates from the prevalent approach of only
characterizing the subject's class identification. SID is generated utilizing
multimodal GPT-4 and can be seamlessly integrated into optimization-based
models. We present comprehensive experimental results along with analyses of
cross-attention maps, subject-alignment, non-subject-disentanglement, and

annotations with 7 degree-of-freedom, which is laborious and time-consuming.
Therefore, the form of point annotations is proposed to offer significant
prospects for practical applications in 3D detection, which is not only more
accessible and less expensive but also provides strong spatial information for
object localization.In this paper, we empirically discover that it is
non-trivial to merely adapt Point-DETR to its 3D form, encountering two main
bottlenecks: 1) it fails to encode strong 3D prior into the model, and 2) it
generates low-quality pseudo labels in distant regions due to the extreme
sparsity of LiDAR points. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
Point-DETR3D, a teacher-student framework for weakly semi-supervised 3D
detection, designed to fully capitalize on point-wise supervision within a
constrained instance-wise annotation budget.Different from Point-DETR which
encodes 3D positional information solely through a point encoder, we propose an
explicit positional query initialization strategy to enhance the positional
prior. Considering the low quality of pseudo labels at distant regions produced
by the teacher model, we enhance the detector's perception by incorporating
dense imagery data through a novel Cross-Modal Deformable RoI Fusion
(D-RoI).Moreover, an innovative point-guided self-supervised learning technique
is proposed to allow for fully exploiting point priors, even in student
models.Extensive experiments on representative nuScenes dataset demonstrate our
Point-DETR3D obtains significant improvements compared to previous works.
Notably, with only 5% of labeled data, Point-DETR3D achieves over 90%
performance of its fully supervised counterpart.

signal-to-noise ratio is still affected by several sources of noise and
artefacts. Moreover, enhancing ultrasound image quality involves balancing
concurrent factors like contrast, resolution, and speckle preservation.
Recently, there has been progress in both model-based and learning-based
approaches addressing the problem of ultrasound image reconstruction. Bringing
the best from both worlds, we propose a hybrid reconstruction method combining
an ultrasound linear direct model with a learning-based prior coming from a
generative Denoising Diffusion model. More specifically, we rely on the
unsupervised fine-tuning of a pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Restoration Model
(DDRM). Given the nature of multiplicative noise inherent to ultrasound, this
paper proposes an empirical model to characterize the stochasticity of
diffusion reconstruction of ultrasound images, and shows the interest of its
variance as an echogenicity map estimator. We conduct experiments on synthetic,
in-vitro, and in-vivo data, demonstrating the efficacy of our variance imaging
approach in achieving high-quality image reconstructions from single plane-wave
acquisitions and in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

and treatment-planning tasks relevant to cardiovascular disease management.
Deep learning provides a means to automatically obtain such models. Ideally, a
user should have control over the exact region of interest (ROI) to be included
in a vascular model, and the model should be watertight and highly accurate. To
this end, we propose a combination of a global controller leveraging voxel mask
segmentations to provide boundary conditions for vessels of interest to a
local, iterative vessel segmentation model. We introduce the preservation of
scale- and rotational symmetries in the local segmentation model, leading to
generalisation to vessels of unseen sizes and orientations. Combined with the
global controller, this enables flexible 3D vascular model building, without
additional retraining. We demonstrate the potential of our method on a dataset
containing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Our method performs on par with a
state-of-the-art segmentation model in the segmentation of AAAs, iliac arteries
and renal arteries, while providing a watertight, smooth surface segmentation.
Moreover, we demonstrate that by adapting the global controller, we can easily
extend vessel sections in the 3D model.

                                        <span>  Accurate detection and tracking of surrounding objects is essential to enable
self-driving vehicles. While Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have
set the benchmark for high performance, the appeal of camera-only solutions
lies in their cost-effectiveness. Notably, despite the prevalent use of Radio
Detection and Ranging (RADAR) sensors in automotive systems, their potential in
3D detection and tracking has been largely disregarded due to data sparsity and
measurement noise. As a recent development, the combination of RADARs and
cameras is emerging as a promising solution. This paper presents Camera-RADAR
3D Detection and Tracking (CR3DT), a camera-RADAR fusion model for 3D object
detection, and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT). Building upon the foundations of
the State-of-the-Art (SotA) camera-only BEVDet architecture, CR3DT demonstrates
substantial improvements in both detection and tracking capabilities, by
incorporating the spatial and velocity information of the RADAR sensor.
Experimental results demonstrate an absolute improvement in detection
performance of 5.3% in mean Average Precision (mAP) and a 14.9% increase in
Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) on the nuScenes dataset when
leveraging both modalities. CR3DT bridges the gap between high-performance and
cost-effective perception systems in autonomous driving, by capitalizing on the
ubiquitous presence of RADAR in automotive applications.

to produce training data specifically "useful" for supervised learning. Unlike
previous works that employ an open-loop approach and pre-define prompts to
generate new data using either a language model or human expertise, we develop
an automated closed-loop system which involves two feedback mechanisms. The
first mechanism uses feedback from a given supervised model and finds
adversarial prompts that result in image generations that maximize the model
loss. While these adversarial prompts result in diverse data informed by the
model, they are not informed of the target distribution, which can be
inefficient. Therefore, we introduce the second feedback mechanism that guides
the generation process towards a certain target distribution. We call the
method combining these two mechanisms Guided Adversarial Prompts. We perform
our evaluations on different tasks, datasets and architectures, with different
types of distribution shifts (spuriously correlated data, unseen domains) and
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed feedback mechanisms compared to
open-loop approaches.

obtaining ground truth pose labels required for the training process remains a
costly endeavor. While current weakly supervised methods excel in lightweight
label generation, their performance notably declines in scenarios with sparse
views. In response to this challenge, we introduce WSCLoc, a system capable of
being customized to various deep learning-based relocalization models to
enhance their performance under weakly-supervised and sparse view conditions.
This is realized with two stages. In the initial stage, WSCLoc employs a
multilayer perceptron-based structure called WFT-NeRF to co-optimize image
reconstruction quality and initial pose information. To ensure a stable
learning process, we incorporate temporal information as input. Furthermore,
instead of optimizing SE(3), we opt for $\mathfrak{sim}(3)$ optimization to
explicitly enforce a scale constraint. In the second stage, we co-optimize the
pre-trained WFT-NeRF and WFT-Pose. This optimization is enhanced by
Time-Encoding based Random View Synthesis and supervised by inter-frame
geometric constraints that consider pose, depth, and RGB information. We
validate our approaches on two publicly available datasets, one outdoor and one
indoor. Our experimental results demonstrate that our weakly-supervised
relocalization solutions achieve superior pose estimation accuracy in
sparse-view scenarios, comparable to state-of-the-art camera relocalization
methods. We will make our code publicly available.

models in safety-critical applications. However, the inherent hierarchical
concept structure of visual data, which is instrumental to OOD detection, is
often poorly captured by conventional methods based on Euclidean geometry. This
work proposes a metric framework that leverages the strengths of Hyperbolic
geometry for OOD detection. Inspired by previous works that refine the decision
boundary for OOD data with synthetic outliers, we extend this method to
Hyperbolic space. Interestingly, we find that synthetic outliers do not benefit
OOD detection in Hyperbolic space as they do in Euclidean space. Furthermore we
explore the relationship between OOD detection performance and Hyperbolic
embedding dimension, addressing practical concerns in resource-constrained
environments. Extensive experiments show that our framework improves the FPR95
for OOD detection from 22\% to 15\% and from 49% to 28% on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 respectively compared to Euclidean methods.

understanding. Particularly, text-to-video diffusion models (VDMs) have
significantly facilitated the customization of input video with target
appearance, motion, etc. Despite these advances, challenges persist in
accurately distilling motion information from video frames. While existing
works leverage the consecutive frame residual as the target motion vector, they
inherently lack global motion context and are vulnerable to frame-wise

novel framework that refines and aligns motion vectors using Fourier and
wavelet transforms. SMA learns motion patterns by incorporating
frequency-domain regularization, facilitating the learning of whole-frame
global motion dynamics, and mitigating spatial artifacts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate SMA's efficacy in improving motion transfer while maintaining

farming into a data-driven, precise, and sustainable industry. Deep learning
has empowered agriculture vision to analyze vast, complex visual data, but
heavily rely on the availability of large annotated datasets. This remains a
bottleneck as manual labeling is error-prone, time-consuming, and expensive.
The lack of efficient labeling approaches inspired us to consider
self-supervised learning as a paradigm shift, learning meaningful feature
representations from raw agricultural image data. In this work, we explore how
self-supervised representation learning unlocks the potential applicability to
diverse agriculture vision tasks by eliminating the need for large-scale

unannotated dataset of real-world agriculture field images. Our experimental
analysis and results indicate that the model learns robust features applicable
to a broad range of downstream agriculture tasks discussed in the paper.
Additionally, the reduced reliance on annotated data makes our approach more
cost-effective and accessible, paving the way for broader adoption of computer
vision in agriculture.

manageable object representations, enhancing the understanding and reasoning
abilities of machine learning systems toward the physical world. Recently,
slot-based video models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in segmenting
and tracking objects, but they overlook the importance of the effective
reasoning module. In the real world, reasoning and predictive abilities play a
crucial role in human perception and object tracking; in particular, these
abilities are closely related to human intuitive physics. Inspired by this, we
designed a novel reasoning module called the Slot-based Time-Space Transformer
with Memory buffer (STATM) to enhance the model's perception ability in complex
scenes. The memory buffer primarily serves as storage for slot information from
upstream modules, the Slot-based Time-Space Transformer makes predictions
through slot-based spatiotemporal attention computations and fusion. Our
experiment results on various datasets show that STATM can significantly
enhance object-centric learning capabilities of slot-based video models.

                                        <span>  Bird's eye view (BEV) representation has emerged as a dominant solution for
describing 3D space in autonomous driving scenarios. However, objects in the
BEV representation typically exhibit small sizes, and the associated point
cloud context is inherently sparse, which leads to great challenges for
reliable 3D perception. In this paper, we propose IS-Fusion, an innovative
multimodal fusion framework that jointly captures the Instance- and Scene-level
contextual information. IS-Fusion essentially differs from existing approaches
that only focus on the BEV scene-level fusion by explicitly incorporating
instance-level multimodal information, thus facilitating the instance-centric
tasks like 3D object detection. It comprises a Hierarchical Scene Fusion (HSF)
module and an Instance-Guided Fusion (IGF) module. HSF applies Point-to-Grid
and Grid-to-Region transformers to capture the multimodal scene context at
different granularities. IGF mines instance candidates, explores their
relationships, and aggregates the local multimodal context for each instance.
These instances then serve as guidance to enhance the scene feature and yield
an instance-aware BEV representation. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
IS-Fusion outperforms all the published multimodal works to date. Code is

whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is
typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level
(e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a
need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We
propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model
interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish
the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label.
We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast
cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly
connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant
to both research and diagnostic applications.

inserted foreground remains a formidable challenge. Previous works have
developed image-to-image translation models which are trained on paired
training data. However, they are struggling to generate shadows with accurate
shapes and intensities, hindered by data scarcity and inherent task complexity.
In this paper, we resort to foundation model with rich prior knowledge of
natural shadow images. Specifically, we first adapt ControlNet to our task and
then propose intensity modulation modules to improve the shadow intensity.
Moreover, we extend the small-scale DESOBA dataset to DESOBAv2 using a novel
data acquisition pipeline. Experimental results on both DESOBA and DESOBAv2
datasets as well as real composite images demonstrate the superior capability
of our model for shadow generation task. The dataset, code, and model are

to zero-shot settings. However, the degree of stylization achieved by existing
methods is often not sufficient for practical applications because they are
mostly based on statistical 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) with limited variations.
To this end, we propose a method that can produce a highly stylized 3D face
model with desired topology. Our methods train a surface deformation network
with 3DMM and translate its domain to the target style using a paired exemplar.
The network achieves stylization of the 3D face mesh by mimicking the style of
the target using a differentiable renderer and directional CLIP losses.
Additionally, during the inference process, we utilize a Mesh Agnostic Encoder
(MAGE) that takes deformation target, a mesh of diverse topologies as input to
the stylization process and encodes its shape into our latent space. The
resulting stylized face model can be animated by commonly used 3DMM blend
shapes. A set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our
method can produce highly stylized face meshes according to a given style and
output them in a desired topology. We also demonstrate example applications of
our method including image-based stylized avatar generation, linear
interpolation of geometric styles, and facial animation of stylized avatars.

foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have revolutionized
semantic segmentation with exceptional zero-shot generalizability across

streamlining the annotation process. However, SAM has yet to be evaluated in a

models. In this work, we explore the potential of SAM for crowd-sourcing
"sparse" annotations from non-experts to generate "dense" segmentation masks
for training 3D nnU-Net models, a state-of-the-art DL segmentation model. Our
results indicate that while SAM-generated annotations exhibit high mean Dice
scores compared to ground-truth annotations, nnU-Net models trained on
SAM-generated annotations perform significantly worse than nnU-Net models
trained on ground-truth annotations ($p<0.001$, all).

                                        <span>  Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) in videos is an important but
challenging task in computer vision. The recent state-of-the-art models for SAR
are primarily based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), which are
powerful in extracting the spatial information of skeleton data. However, it is
yet clear that such GCN-based models can effectively capture the temporal
dynamics of human action sequences. To this end, we propose the DevLSTM module,
which exploits the path development -- a principled and parsimonious
representation for sequential data by leveraging the Lie group structure. The
path development, originated from Rough path theory, can effectively capture
the order of events in high-dimensional stream data with massive dimension
reduction and consequently enhance the LSTM module substantially. Our proposed
G-DevLSTM module can be conveniently plugged into the temporal graph,
complementing existing advanced GCN-based models. Our empirical studies on the
NTU60, NTU120 and Chalearn2013 datasets demonstrate that our proposed hybrid
model significantly outperforms the current best-performing methods in SAR
tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/DeepIntoStreams/GCN-DevLSTM.

                                        <span>  Multispectral pedestrian detection is attractive for around-the-clock
applications due to the complementary information between RGB and thermal
modalities. However, current models often fail to detect pedestrians in obvious
cases, especially due to the modality bias learned from statistically biased
datasets. From these problems, we anticipate that maybe understanding the
complementary information itself is difficult to achieve from vision-only
models. Accordingly, we propose a novel Multispectral Chain-of-Thought
Detection (MSCoTDet) framework, which incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs)
to understand the complementary information at the semantic level and further
enhance the fusion process. Specifically, we generate text descriptions of the
pedestrian in each RGB and thermal modality and design a Multispectral
Chain-of-Thought (MSCoT) prompting, which models a step-by-step process to
facilitate cross-modal reasoning at the semantic level and perform accurate
detection. Moreover, we design a Language-driven Multi-modal Fusion (LMF)
strategy that enables fusing vision-driven and language-driven detections.
Extensive experiments validate that MSCoTDet improves multispectral pedestrian
detection.

broader adoption of robotic systems. In this work, we address the problem of
one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video
recording through a two-stage process. In the first stage which is offline, we
extract the trajectory of the demonstration. This entails segmenting
manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to
secondary objects such as containers. Subsequently, in the live online
trajectory generation stage, we first \mbox{re-detect} all objects, then we
warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene, and finally, we trace
the trajectory with the robot. To complete these steps, our method makes
leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative
object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate
different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate
our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect
demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as
articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a
real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach
in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at

                                        <span>  The landscape of deep learning research is moving towards innovative
strategies to harness the true potential of data. Traditionally, emphasis has
been on scaling model architectures, resulting in large and complex neural
networks, which can be difficult to train with limited computational resources.
However, independently of the model size, data quality (i.e. amount and
variability) is still a major factor that affects model generalization. In this
work, we propose a novel technique to exploit available data through the use of
automatic data augmentation for the tasks of image classification and semantic
segmentation. We introduce the first Differentiable Augmentation Search method
(DAS) to generate variations of images that can be processed as videos.
Compared to previous approaches, DAS is extremely fast and flexible, allowing
the search on very large search spaces in less than a GPU day. Our intuition is
that the increased receptive field in the temporal dimension provided by DAS
could lead to benefits also to the spatial receptive field. More specifically,
we leverage DAS to guide the reshaping of the spatial receptive field by
selecting task-dependant transformations. As a result, compared to standard
augmentation alternatives, we improve in terms of accuracy on ImageNet,
Cifar10, Cifar100, Tiny-ImageNet, Pascal-VOC-2012 and CityScapes datasets when
plugging-in our DAS over different light-weight video backbones.

low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth, offer unique capabilities for
object detection in specialized contexts. Despite these advantages, the
inherent sparsity and asynchrony of event data pose challenges to existing
object detection algorithms. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the
way the human brain codes and processes information, offer a potential solution
to these difficulties. However, their performance in object detection using
event cameras is limited in current implementations. In this paper, we propose
the Spiking Fusion Object Detector (SFOD), a simple and efficient approach to
SNN-based object detection. Specifically, we design a Spiking Fusion Module,
achieving the first-time fusion of feature maps from different scales in SNNs
applied to event cameras. Additionally, through integrating our analysis and
experiments conducted during the pretraining of the backbone network on the
NCAR dataset, we delve deeply into the impact of spiking decoding strategies
and loss functions on model performance. Thereby, we establish state-of-the-art
classification results based on SNNs, achieving 93.7\% accuracy on the NCAR
dataset. Experimental results on the GEN1 detection dataset demonstrate that
the SFOD achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 32.1\%, outperforming existing
SNN-based approaches. Our research not only underscores the potential of SNNs
in object detection with event cameras but also propels the advancement of
SNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/yimeng-fan/SFOD.

geometric interpretability. In this article we focus on Euclidean equivariant
PDE-G-CNNs where the feature maps are two dimensional throughout. We call this
variant of the framework a PDE-CNN. We list several practically desirable
axioms and derive from these which PDEs should be used in a PDE-CNN. Here our
approach to geometric learning via PDEs is inspired by the axioms of classical
linear and morphological scale-space theory, which we generalize by introducing
semifield-valued signals. Furthermore, we experimentally confirm for small
networks that PDE-CNNs offer fewer parameters, better performance, and data
efficiency in comparison to CNNs. We also investigate what effect the use of
different semifields has on the performance of the models.

LiDAR perception methods that are both efficient and effective. Although
naively enlarging 3D kernel size can enhance performance, it will also lead to

beginning to learn a large sparse 3D kernel. It not only boosts performance but
also significantly reduces model size and computational cost. Moreover, CWS
selects the most important channels for 3D convolution during training and
subsequently prunes the redundant channels to accelerate inference for 3D
vision tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LSK3DNet on three benchmark
datasets and five tracks compared with classical models and large kernel
designs. Notably, LSK3DNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
SemanticKITTI (i.e., 75.6% on single-scan and 63.4% on multi-scan), with
roughly 40% model size reduction and 60% computing operations reduction
compared to the naive large 3D kernel model.

important applications for augmented reality and robotics. Current
state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive as they individually
encode each detected object and optimise CAD alignments in a second stage. In
this work, we propose FastCAD, a real-time method that simultaneously retrieves
and aligns CAD models for all objects in a given scene. In contrast to previous
works, we directly predict alignment parameters and shape embeddings. We
achieve high-quality shape retrievals by learning CAD embeddings in a
contrastive learning framework and distilling those into FastCAD. Our
single-stage method accelerates the inference time by a factor of 50 compared
to other methods operating on RGB-D scans while outperforming them on the
challenging Scan2CAD alignment benchmark. Further, our approach collaborates
seamlessly with online 3D reconstruction techniques. This enables the real-time
generation of precise CAD model-based reconstructions from videos at 10 FPS.
Doing so, we significantly improve the Scan2CAD alignment accuracy in the video
setting from 43.0% to 48.2% and the reconstruction accuracy from 22.9% to
29.6%.

                                        <span>  Environmental perception in Automated Valet Parking (AVP) has been a
challenging task due to severe occlusions in parking garages. Although
Collaborative Perception (CP) can be applied to broaden the field of view of
connected vehicles, the limited bandwidth of vehicular communications restricts
its application. In this work, we propose a BEV feature-based CP network
architecture for infrastructure-assisted AVP systems. The model takes the
roadside camera and LiDAR as optional inputs and adaptively fuses them with
onboard sensors in a unified BEV representation. Autoencoder and downsampling
are applied for channel-wise and spatial-wise dimension reduction, while
sparsification and quantization further compress the feature map with little
loss in data precision. Combining these techniques, the size of a BEV feature
map is effectively compressed to fit in the feasible data rate of the NR-V2X
network. With the synthetic AVP dataset, we observe that CP can effectively
increase perception performance, especially for pedestrians. Moreover, the
advantage of infrastructure-assisted CP is demonstrated in two typical
safety-critical scenarios in the AVP setting, increasing the maximum safe
cruising speed by up to 3m/s in both scenarios.

changed how digital content is created. With the latest AI technology, millions
of high quality images are being generated by the public, which are constantly
motivating the research community to push the limits of generative models to
create more complex and realistic images. This paper focuses on Cross-Domain
Image Retrieval (CDIR) which can be used as an additional tool to inspect
collections of generated images by determining the level of similarity between
images in a dataset. An ideal retrieval system would be able to generalize to
unseen complex images from multiple domains (e.g., photos, drawings and
paintings). To address this goal, we propose a novel caption-matching approach
that leverages multimodal language-vision architectures pre-trained on large
datasets. The method is tested on DomainNet and Office-Home datasets and
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over the latest approaches
in the literature for cross-domain image retrieval. In order to verify the
effectiveness with AI-generated images, the method was also put to test with a
database composed by samples collected from Midjourney, which is a widely used
generative platform for content creation.

complex classification tasks, increasingly delivering better results thanks to
the development of more accurate models, the availability of huge volumes of
data and the improved computational capabilities of modern computers. However,
these improvements in performance also bring efficiency problems, related to
the storage of datasets and models, and to the waste of energy and time
involved in both the training and inference processes. In this context, data
reduction can help reduce energy consumption when training a deep learning
model. In this paper, we present up to eight different methods to reduce the
size of a tabular training dataset, and we develop a Python package to apply
them. We also introduce a representativeness metric based on topology to
measure how similar are the reduced datasets and the full training dataset.
Additionally, we develop a methodology to apply these data reduction methods to
image datasets for object detection tasks. Finally, we experimentally compare
how these data reduction methods affect the representativeness of the reduced
dataset, the energy consumption and the predictive performance of the model.

                                        <span>  Image annotation is one of the most essential tasks for guaranteeing proper
treatment for patients and tracking progress over the course of therapy in the
field of medical imaging and disease diagnosis. However, manually annotating a
lot of 2D and 3D imaging data can be extremely tedious. Deep Learning (DL)
based segmentation algorithms have completely transformed this process and made
it possible to automate image segmentation. By accurately segmenting medical
images, these algorithms can greatly minimize the time and effort necessary for
manual annotation. Additionally, by incorporating Active Learning (AL) methods,
these segmentation algorithms can perform far more effectively with a smaller
amount of ground truth data. We introduce MedDeepCyleAL, an end-to-end
framework implementing the complete AL cycle. It provides researchers with the
flexibility to choose the type of deep learning model they wish to employ and
includes an annotation tool that supports the classification and segmentation
of medical images. The user-friendly interface allows for easy alteration of
the AL and DL model settings through a configuration file, requiring no prior
programming experience. While MedDeepCyleAL can be applied to any kind of image
data, we have specifically applied it to ophthalmology data in this project.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose Image Downscaling Assessment by Rate-Distortion
(IDA-RD), a novel measure to quantitatively evaluate image downscaling
algorithms. In contrast to image-based methods that measure the quality of
downscaled images, ours is process-based that draws ideas from rate-distortion
theory to measure the distortion incurred during downscaling. Our main idea is
that downscaling and super-resolution (SR) can be viewed as the encoding and
decoding processes in the rate-distortion model, respectively, and that a
downscaling algorithm that preserves more details in the resulting
low-resolution (LR) images should lead to less distorted high-resolution (HR)
images in SR. In other words, the distortion should increase as the downscaling
algorithm deteriorates. However, it is non-trivial to measure this distortion
as it requires the SR algorithm to be blind and stochastic. Our key insight is
that such requirements can be met by recent SR algorithms based on deep
generative models that can find all matching HR images for a given LR image on
their learned image manifolds. Extensive experimental results show the
effectiveness of our IDA-RD measure.

                                        <span>  Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision. While prevailing
deep learning-based supervised and self-supervised methods have excelled in
eliminating in-distribution noise, their susceptibility to out-of-distribution
(OOD) noise remains a significant challenge. The recent emergence of
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model has showcased exceptional
capabilities in open-world image recognition and segmentation. Yet, the
potential for leveraging CLIP to enhance the robustness of low-level tasks
remains largely unexplored. This paper uncovers that certain dense features
extracted from the frozen ResNet image encoder of CLIP exhibit
distortion-invariant and content-related properties, which are highly desirable
for generalizable denoising. Leveraging these properties, we devise an
asymmetrical encoder-decoder denoising network, which incorporates dense
features including the noisy image and its multi-scale features from the frozen
ResNet encoder of CLIP into a learnable image decoder to achieve generalizable
denoising. The progressive feature augmentation strategy is further proposed to
mitigate feature overfitting and improve the robustness of the learnable
decoder. Extensive experiments and comparisons conducted across diverse OOD
noises, including synthetic noise, real-world sRGB noise, and low-dose CT image
noise, demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our method.

                                        <span>  Current semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) algorithms typically assume
class balanced datasets (PASCAL VOC etc.) or slightly class imbalanced datasets
(MS-COCO, etc). This assumption can be easily violated since real world
datasets can be extremely class imbalanced in nature, thus making the
performance of semi-supervised object detectors far from satisfactory. Besides,
the research for this problem in SSOD is severely under-explored. To bridge
this research gap, we comprehensively study the class imbalance problem for
SSOD under more challenging scenarios, thus forming the first experimental
setting for class imbalanced SSOD (CI-SSOD). Moreover, we propose a simple yet
effective gradient-based sampling framework that tackles the class imbalance
problem from the perspective of two types of confirmation biases. To tackle
confirmation bias towards majority classes, the gradient-based reweighting and
gradient-based thresholding modules leverage the gradients from each class to
fully balance the influence of the majority and minority classes. To tackle the
confirmation bias from incorrect pseudo labels of minority classes, the
class-rebalancing sampling module resamples unlabeled data following the
guidance of the gradient-based reweighting module. Experiments on three
proposed sub-tasks, namely MS-COCO, MS-COCO to Object365 and LVIS, suggest that
our method outperforms current class imbalanced object detectors by clear
margins, serving as a baseline for future research in CI-SSOD. Code will be
available at https://github.com/nightkeepers/CI-SSOD.

real-time online visualization are critical for intrabody medical imaging
devices such as endoscopes and capsule robots. However, existing SLAM
(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) methods often struggle to achieve both
complete high-quality surgical field reconstruction and efficient computation,
restricting their intraoperative applications among endoscopic surgeries. In
this paper, we introduce EndoGSLAM, an efficient SLAM approach for endoscopic
surgeries, which integrates streamlined Gaussian representation and
differentiable rasterization to facilitate over 100 fps rendering speed during
online camera tracking and tissue reconstructing. Extensive experiments show
that EndoGSLAM achieves a better trade-off between intraoperative availability
and reconstruction quality than traditional or neural SLAM approaches, showing
tremendous potential for endoscopic surgeries. The project page is at

profound societal impact. Identifying risk markers early is crucial for
understanding disease progression and enabling preventive measures. The Danish
High Risk and Resilience Study (VIA) focuses on understanding early disease
processes, particularly in children with familial high risk (FHR).
Understanding structural brain changes associated with these diseases during
early stages is essential for effective interventions. The central sulcus (CS)
is a prominent brain landmark related to brain regions involved in motor and
sensory processing. Analyzing CS morphology can provide valuable insights into
neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the FHR group. However, segmenting the
central sulcus (CS) presents challenges due to its variability, especially in
adolescents. This study introduces two novel approaches to improve CS
segmentation: synthetic data generation to model CS variability and
self-supervised pre-training with multi-task learning to adapt models to new
cohorts. These methods aim to enhance segmentation performance across diverse
populations, eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing.

data-driven deep learning techniques. However, the existing benchmark datasets
lack diversity, and models trained on these data cannot generalize well to
dynamic wild scenarios. To meet the goal of improving the explicit
generalization of ReID models, we develop a new Open-World, Diverse,
Cross-Spatial-Temporal dataset named OWD with several distinct features. 1)
Diverse collection scenes: multiple independent open-world and highly dynamic
collecting scenes, including streets, intersections, shopping malls, etc. 2)
Diverse lighting variations: long time spans from daytime to nighttime with
abundant illumination changes. 3) Diverse person status: multiple camera
networks in all seasons with normal/adverse weather conditions and diverse
pedestrian appearances (e.g., clothes, personal belongings, poses, etc.). 4)
Protected privacy: invisible faces for privacy critical applications. To
improve the implicit generalization of ReID, we further propose a Latent Domain
Expansion (LDE) method to develop the potential of source data, which decouples
discriminative identity-relevant and trustworthy domain-relevant features and
implicitly enforces domain-randomized identity feature space expansion with
richer domain diversity to facilitate domain invariant representations. Our
comprehensive evaluations with most benchmark datasets in the community are
crucial for progress, although this work is far from the grand goal toward
open-world and dynamic wild applications.

goal is to equip robots with a similar capability, which we term \ourmodel.
\ourmodel aims to predict the expected touch signal based on a visual patch
representing the touched area. We frame this problem as the task of learning a
low-dimensional visual-tactile embedding, wherein we encode a depth patch from
which we decode the tactile signal. To accomplish this task, we employ ReSkin,
an inexpensive and replaceable magnetic-based tactile sensor. Using ReSkin, we
collect and train PseudoTouch on a dataset comprising aligned tactile and
visual data pairs obtained through random touching of eight basic geometric
shapes. We demonstrate the efficacy of PseudoTouch through its application to
two downstream tasks: object recognition and grasp stability prediction. In the
object recognition task, we evaluate the learned embedding's performance on a
set of five basic geometric shapes and five household objects. Using
PseudoTouch, we achieve an object recognition accuracy 84% after just ten
touches, surpassing a proprioception baseline. For the grasp stability task, we
use ACRONYM labels to train and evaluate a grasp success predictor using
PseudoTouch's predictions derived from virtual depth information. Our approach
yields an impressive 32% absolute improvement in accuracy compared to the
baseline relying on partial point cloud data. We make the data, code, and
trained models publicly available at http://pseudotouch.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

                                        <span>  Segmentation of fetal brain tissue from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
plays a crucial role in the study of in utero neurodevelopment. However,
automated tools face substantial domain shift challenges as they must be robust
to highly heterogeneous clinical data, often limited in numbers and lacking
annotations. Indeed, high variability of the fetal brain morphology, MRI
acquisition parameters, and superresolution reconstruction (SR) algorithms
adversely affect the model's performance when evaluated out-of-domain. In this
work, we introduce FetalSynthSeg, a domain randomization method to segment
fetal brain MRI, inspired by SynthSeg. Our results show that models trained
solely on synthetic data outperform models trained on real data in out-ofdomain
settings, validated on a 120-subject cross-domain dataset. Furthermore, we
extend our evaluation to 40 subjects acquired using lowfield (0.55T) MRI and
reconstructed with novel SR models, showcasing robustness across different
magnetic field strengths and SR algorithms. Leveraging a generative synthetic
approach, we tackle the domain shift problem in fetal brain MRI and offer
compelling prospects for applications in fields with limited and highly
heterogeneous data.

                                        <span>  Vehicle trajectory prediction has increasingly relied on data-driven
solutions, but their ability to scale to different data domains and the impact
of larger dataset sizes on their generalization remain under-explored. While
these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is
challenging due to several discrepancies, \textit{e.g.,} in data formats, map
resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we
introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets,
models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle
trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive
experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when
transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can
substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for
the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to
explain these findings. The code can be found here:

                                        <span>  Training a computer vision system to segment a novel class typically requires
collecting and painstakingly annotating lots of images with objects from that
class. Few-shot segmentation techniques reduce the required number of images to
learn to segment a new class, but careful annotations of object boundaries are
still required. On the other hand, interactive segmentation techniques only
focus on incrementally improving the segmentation of one object at a time
(typically, using clicks given by an expert) in a class-agnostic manner. We
combine the two concepts to drastically reduce the effort required to train
segmentation models for novel classes. Instead of trivially feeding interactive
segmentation masks as ground truth to a few-shot segmentation model, we propose
IFSENet, which can accept sparse supervision on a single or few support images
in the form of clicks to generate masks on support (training, at least clicked
upon once) as well as query (test, never clicked upon) images. To trade-off
effort for accuracy flexibly, the number of images and clicks can be
incrementally added to the support set to further improve the segmentation of
support as well as query images. The proposed model approaches the accuracy of
previous state-of-the-art few-shot segmentation models with considerably lower
annotation effort (clicks instead of maps), when tested on Pascal and SBD
datasets on query images. It also works well as an interactive segmentation
method on support images.

(cellVIB), a convolutional neural network using information bottleneck
mechanism, which can be combined with the latest feedforward network
architecture in an end-to-end training method. Our Cell Variational Information
Bottleneck Network is constructed by stacking VIB cells, which generate feature
maps with uncertainty. As layers going deeper, the regularization effect will
gradually increase, instead of directly adding excessive regular constraints to
the output layer of the model as in Deep VIB. Under each VIB cell, the
feedforward process learns an independent mean term and an standard deviation
term, and predicts the Gaussian distribution based on them. The feedback
process is based on reparameterization trick for effective training. This work
performs an extensive analysis on MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of
each VIB cells, and provides an insightful analysis on how the VIB cells affect
mutual information. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 also prove that our
cellVIB is robust against noisy labels during training and against corrupted
images during testing. Then, we validate our method on PACS dataset, whose
results show that the VIB cells can significantly improve the generalization
performance of the basic model. Finally, in a more complex representation
learning task, face recognition, our network structure has also achieved very
competitive results.

                                        <span>  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to
multiple instance learning with convolutional neural networks in digital
pathology, offering superior handling of structural information across various
spatial ranges - a crucial aspect of learning from gigapixel H&E-stained whole
slide images (WSI). However, graph message-passing algorithms often suffer from
oversmoothing when aggregating a large neighborhood. Hence, effective modeling
of multi-range interactions relies on the careful construction of the graph.
Our proposed multi-scale GCN (MS-GCN) tackles this issue by leveraging
information across multiple magnification levels in WSIs. MS-GCN enables the
simultaneous modeling of long-range structural dependencies at lower
magnifications and high-resolution cellular details at higher magnifications,
akin to analysis pipelines usually conducted by pathologists. The
architecture's unique configuration allows for the concurrent modeling of
structural patterns at lower magnifications and detailed cellular features at
higher ones, while also quantifying the contribution of each magnification
level to the prediction. Through testing on different datasets, MS-GCN
demonstrates superior performance over existing single-magnification GCN
methods. The enhancement in performance and interpretability afforded by our
method holds promise for advancing computational pathology models, especially
in tasks requiring extensive spatial context.

covers 3D reconstruction of general non-rigid scenes and further addresses the
techniques for scene decomposition, editing and controlling, and generalizable
and generative modeling. More specifically, we first review the common and
fundamental concepts necessary to understand and navigate the field and then
discuss the state-of-the-art techniques by reviewing recent approaches that use
traditional and machine-learning-based neural representations, including a
discussion on the newly enabled applications. The STAR is concluded with a

                                        <span>  Segment anything model (SAM) demonstrates strong generalization ability on
natural image segmentation. However, its direct adaption in medical image
segmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy
and unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points
to obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI
scans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although
quite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the
efficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods
only capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors. In this work, we propose a
comprehensive and scalable 3D SAM model for whole-body CT segmentation, named
CT-SAM3D. Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation
model using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,
ensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts
is crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory
constraints. For this purpose, we propose two key technical developments: 1) a
progressively and spatially aligned prompt encoding method to effectively
encode click prompts in local 3D space; and 2) a cross-patch prompt learning
scheme to capture more 3D spatial context, which is beneficial for reducing the
editing workloads when interactively prompting on large organs. CT-SAM3D is
trained and validated using a curated dataset of 1204 CT scans containing 107
whole-body anatomies, reporting significantly better quantitative performance
against all previous SAM-derived models by a large margin with much fewer click
prompts. Our model can handle segmenting unseen organ as well. Code, data, and
our 3D interactive segmentation tool with quasi-real-time responses will be
made publicly available.

contrasts and colors than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos, giving more
vivid experiences. Due to this, HDR videos are expected to grow into the
dominant video modality of the future. However, HDR videos are incompatible
with existing SDR displays, which form the majority of affordable consumer
displays on the market. Because of this, HDR videos must be processed by
tone-mapping them to reduced bit-depths to service a broad swath of SDR-limited
video consumers. Here, we analyze the impact of tone-mapping operators on the
visual quality of streaming HDR videos. To this end, we built the first
large-scale subjectively annotated open-source database of compressed
tone-mapped HDR videos, containing 15,000 tone-mapped sequences derived from 40
unique HDR source contents. The videos in the database were labeled with more
than 750,000 subjective quality annotations, collected from more than 1,600
unique human observers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new subjective
database by benchmarking objective models of visual quality on it. We envision
that the new LIVE Tone-Mapped HDR (LIVE-TMHDR) database will enable significant
progress on HDR video tone mapping and quality assessment in the future. To
this end, we make the database freely available to the community at

                                        <span>  Recent advances in tuning-free personalized image generation based on
diffusion models are impressive. However, to improve subject fidelity, existing
methods either retrain the diffusion model or infuse it with dense visual
embeddings, both of which suffer from poor generalization and efficiency. Also,
these methods falter in multi-subject image generation due to the unconstrained
cross-attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose MM-Diff, a unified and
tuning-free image personalization framework capable of generating high-fidelity
images of both single and multiple subjects in seconds. Specifically, to
simultaneously enhance text consistency and subject fidelity, MM-Diff employs a
vision encoder to transform the input image into CLS and patch embeddings. CLS
embeddings are used on the one hand to augment the text embeddings, and on the
other hand together with patch embeddings to derive a small number of
detail-rich subject embeddings, both of which are efficiently integrated into
the diffusion model through the well-designed multimodal cross-attention
mechanism. Additionally, MM-Diff introduces cross-attention map constraints
during the training phase, ensuring flexible multi-subject image sampling
during inference without any predefined inputs (e.g., layout). Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MM-Diff over other leading
methods.

natural language instructions and the visual information they observe. Existing
methods for training VLN agents presuppose fixed datasets, leading to a
significant limitation: the introduction of new environments necessitates
retraining with previously encountered environments to preserve their
knowledge. This makes it difficult to train VLN agents that operate in the
ever-changing real world. To address this limitation, we present the Continual
Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm, designed to evaluate agents
trained through a continual learning process. For the training and evaluation
of CVLN agents, we re-arrange existing VLN datasets to propose two datasets:
CVLN-I, focused on navigation via initial-instruction interpretation, and
CVLN-D, aimed at navigation through dialogue with other agents. Furthermore, we
propose two novel rehearsal-based methods for CVLN, Perplexity Replay (PerpR)
and Episodic Self-Replay (ESR). PerpR prioritizes replaying challenging
episodes based on action perplexity, while ESR replays previously predicted
action logits to preserve learned behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed methods on CVLN through extensive experiments.

                                        <span>  Contemporary makeup approaches primarily hinge on unpaired learning
paradigms, yet they grapple with the challenges of inaccurate supervision
(e.g., face misalignment) and sophisticated facial prompts (including face
parsing, and landmark detection). These challenges prohibit low-cost deployment
of facial makeup models, especially on mobile devices. To solve above problems,
we propose a brand-new learning paradigm, termed "Data Amplify Learning (DAL),"
alongside a compact makeup model named "TinyBeauty." The core idea of DAL lies
in employing a Diffusion-based Data Amplifier (DDA) to "amplify" limited images
for the model training, thereby enabling accurate pixel-to-pixel supervision
with merely a handful of annotations. Two pivotal innovations in DDA facilitate
the above training approach: (1) A Residual Diffusion Model (RDM) is designed
to generate high-fidelity detail and circumvent the detail vanishing problem in
the vanilla diffusion models; (2) A Fine-Grained Makeup Module (FGMM) is
proposed to achieve precise makeup control and combination while retaining face
identity. Coupled with DAL, TinyBeauty necessitates merely 80K parameters to
achieve a state-of-the-art performance without intricate face prompts.
Meanwhile, TinyBeauty achieves a remarkable inference speed of up to 460 fps on
the iPhone 13. Extensive experiments show that DAL can produce highly
competitive makeup models using only 5 image pairs.

                                        <span>  Open-pit mine change detection (CD) in high-resolution (HR) remote sensing
images plays a crucial role in mineral development and environmental
protection. Significant progress has been made in this field in recent years,
largely due to the advancement of deep learning techniques. However, existing
deep-learning-based CD methods encounter challenges in effectively integrating
neighborhood and scale information, resulting in suboptimal performance.
Therefore, by exploring the influence patterns of neighborhood and scale
information, this paper proposes an Integrated Neighborhood and Scale
Information Network (INSINet) for open-pit mine CD in HR remote sensing images.
Specifically, INSINet introduces 8-neighborhood-image information to acquire a
larger receptive field, improving the recognition of center image boundary
regions. Drawing on techniques of skip connection, deep supervision, and
attention mechanism, the multi-path deep supervised attention (MDSA) module is
designed to enhance multi-scale information fusion and change feature
extraction. Experimental analysis reveals that incorporating neighborhood and
scale information enhances the F1 score of INSINet by 6.40%, with improvements
of 3.08% and 3.32% respectively. INSINet outperforms existing methods with an
Overall Accuracy of 97.69%, Intersection over Union of 71.26%, and F1 score of
83.22%. INSINet shows significance for open-pit mine CD in HR remote sensing
images.

of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the main problems of
variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the
optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the
quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this
problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In
this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is
introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with
$C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against
two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the
geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical
equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for
the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ
devices.

                                        <span>  As a part of the perception results of intelligent driving systems, static
object detection (SOD) in 3D space provides crucial cues for driving
environment understanding. With the rapid deployment of deep neural networks
for SOD tasks, the demand for high-quality training samples soars. The
traditional, also reliable, way is manual labeling over the dense LiDAR point
clouds and reference images. Though most public driving datasets adopt this
strategy to provide SOD ground truth (GT), it is still expensive (requires
LiDAR scanners) and low-efficient (time-consuming and unscalable) in practice.
This paper introduces VRSO, a visual-centric approach for static object
annotation. VRSO is distinguished in low cost, high efficiency, and high
quality: (1) It recovers static objects in 3D space with only camera images as
input, and (2) manual labeling is barely involved since GT for SOD tasks is
generated based on an automatic reconstruction and annotation pipeline. (3)
Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that the mean reprojection error
from VRSO annotation is only 2.6 pixels, around four times lower than the Waymo
labeling (10.6 pixels). Source code is available at:

                                        <span>  3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a crucial task, but point-level
annotations are tedious in fully supervised settings. Thus, using bounding
boxes (bboxes) as annotations has shown great potential. The current mainstream
approach is a two-step process, involving the generation of pseudo-labels from
box annotations and the training of a 3DIS network with the pseudo-labels.
However, due to the presence of intersections among bboxes, not every point has
a determined instance label, especially in overlapping areas. To generate
higher quality pseudo-labels and achieve more precise weakly supervised 3DIS
results, we propose the Box-Supervised Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher for 3D
Instance Segmentation (BSNet), which devises a novel pseudo-labeler called
Simulation-assisted Transformer. The labeler consists of two main components.
The first is Simulation-assisted Mean Teacher, which introduces Mean Teacher
for the first time in this task and constructs simulated samples to assist the
labeler in acquiring prior knowledge about overlapping areas. To better model
local-global structure, we also propose Local-Global Aware Attention as the
decoder for teacher and student labelers. Extensive experiments conducted on
the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets verify the superiority of our designs. Code is

winter conditions in the Nordic regions, characterized by heavy snowfall,
reduced visibility, and low lighting. Due to their susceptibility to
environmental distortions and occlusions, traditional vehicle detection methods
have struggled in these adverse conditions. The advanced proposed deep learning
architectures brought promise, yet the unique difficulties of detecting
vehicles in Nordic winters remain inadequately addressed. This study uses the
Nordic Vehicle Dataset (NVD), which has UAV images from northern Sweden, to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art vehicle detection algorithms under
challenging weather conditions. Our methodology includes a comprehensive
evaluation of single-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based detectors against
the NVD. We propose a series of enhancements tailored to each detection
framework, including data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, transfer
learning, and novel strategies designed explicitly for the DETR model. Our
findings not only highlight the limitations of current detection systems in the
Nordic environment but also offer promising directions for enhancing these
algorithms for improved robustness and accuracy in vehicle detection amidst the
complexities of winter landscapes. The code and the dataset are available at

                                        <span>  In image classification, a significant problem arises from bias in the
datasets. When it contains only specific types of images, the classifier begins
to rely on shortcuts - simplistic and erroneous rules for decision-making. This
leads to high performance on the training dataset but inferior results on new,
varied images, as the classifier's generalization capability is reduced. For
example, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the
model may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the
presence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the
model's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using
bounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations
requires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel
patch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to
capture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for
mitigating bias. Our method consists of two steps. First, we extract the
approximate location of a target using a pre-trained saliency detection model
supplemented by human verification for accuracy. Then, we determine the
human-attentive area in the image by iteratively dividing the image into
smaller patches and employing crowdsourcing to ascertain whether each patch can
be classified as the target object. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our
method in mitigating bias through improved classification accuracy and the
refined focus of the model. Also, crowdsourced experiments validate that our
method collects human annotation up to 3.4 times faster than annotating object
locations with polygons, significantly reducing the need for human resources.
We conclude the paper by discussing the advantages of our method in a
crowdsourcing context, mainly focusing on aspects of human errors and
accessibility.

                                        <span>  Cell tracking and segmentation assist biologists in extracting insights from
large-scale microscopy time-lapse data. Driven by local accuracy metrics,
current tracking approaches often suffer from a lack of long-term consistency.
To address this issue, we introduce an uncertainty estimation technique for
neural tracking-by-regression frameworks and incorporate it into our novel
extended Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture tracker. Our uncertainty estimation
identifies uncertain associations within high-performing tracking-by-regression
methods using problem-specific test-time augmentations. Leveraging this
uncertainty, along with a novel mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation,
our tracker resolves false associations and mitosis detections stemming from
long-term conflicts. We evaluate our approach on nine competitive datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art on biologically
relevant metrics substantially, achieving improvements by a factor of
approximately $5.75$. Furthermore, we uncover new insights into the behavior of
tracking-by-regression uncertainty.

                                        <span>  To gather a significant quantity of annotated training data for
high-performance image classification models, numerous companies opt to enlist
third-party providers to label their unlabeled data. This practice is widely
regarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the
impact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is
negligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison
the training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image
backdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a
fraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.
Specifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to
divide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those
without it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part
to a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target
model after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the
attacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input
image to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the
trigger feature as input. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of our attacks. According to the experimental
results, we conclude that our attacks seriously jeopardize the fairness and
robustness of image classification models, and it is necessary to be vigilant
about the incorrect labels in outsourced labeling.

a known 3D mesh by optimizing its UV texture. The key contributions are
two-fold. We propose an optimal viewpoint selection strategy, that finds the
most miniature set of viewpoints covering all the faces of a mesh. Our
viewpoint selection strategy guarantees the completeness of a generated result.
We propose a recursive optimization pipeline that optimizes a UV texture at
increasing resolutions, with an adaptive denoising method that re-uses existing
textures for new texture generation. Through extensive experimentation, we
demonstrate the superior performance of TexRO in terms of texture quality,
detail preservation, visual consistency, and, notably runtime speed,
outperforming other current methods. The broad applicability of TexRO is
further confirmed through its successful use on diverse 3D models.

                                        <span>  Depth completion is a vital task for autonomous driving, as it involves
reconstructing the precise 3D geometry of a scene from sparse and noisy depth
measurements. However, most existing methods either rely only on 2D depth
representations or directly incorporate raw 3D point clouds for compensation,
which are still insufficient to capture the fine-grained 3D geometry of the
scene. To address this challenge, we introduce Tri-Perspective view
Decomposition (TPVD), a novel framework that can explicitly model 3D geometry.
In particular, (1) TPVD ingeniously decomposes the original point cloud into
three 2D views, one of which corresponds to the sparse depth input. (2) We
design TPV Fusion to update the 2D TPV features through recurrent 2D-3D-2D
aggregation, where a Distance-Aware Spherical Convolution (DASC) is applied.
(3) By adaptively choosing TPV affinitive neighbors, the newly proposed
Geometric Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) further improves the geometric
consistency. As a result, our TPVD outperforms existing methods on KITTI,
NYUv2, and SUN RGBD. Furthermore, we build a novel depth completion dataset
named TOFDC, which is acquired by the time-of-flight (TOF) sensor and the color
camera on smartphones. Project page:

allows the incorporation of different token mixers into a single stage, hence
improving feature extraction capabilities. Integrating both local and global
data allows for precise representation of short- and long-range spatial
relationships without the need for computationally intensive methods such as
shifting windows. Along with the parallel token mixer encoder, We offer the
Convolutional Attention Patch Embedding (CAPE) as an enhancement of standard
patch embedding to improve token mixer extraction with a convolutional
attention module. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our ParFormer
outperforms CNN-based and state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures in
image classification and several complex tasks such as object recognition. The
proposed CAPE has been demonstrated to benefit the overall MetaFormer
architecture, even while utilizing the Identity Mapping Token Mixer, resulting
in a 0.5\% increase in accuracy. The ParFormer models outperformed ConvNeXt and
Swin Transformer for the pure convolution and transformer model in accuracy.
Furthermore, our model surpasses the current leading hybrid transformer by
reaching competitive Top-1 scores in the ImageNet-1K classification test.
Specifically, our model variants with 11M, 23M, and 34M parameters achieve
scores of 80.4\%, 82.1\%, and 83.1\%, respectively. Code:

exemplified by LLMs (Large Language Models), making inference on small-scale
computers more difficult. Model compression technology is, therefore, essential
for integration into products. In this paper, we propose a method of
quantization-aware training. We introduce a novel normalization (Layer-Batch
Normalization) that is independent of the mini-batch size and does not require
any additional computation cost during inference. Then, we quantize the weights
by the scaled round-clip function with the weight standardization. We also
quantize activation functions using the same function and apply surrogate
gradients to train the model with both quantized weights and the quantized
activation functions. We call this method Magic for the age of Quantised DNNs
(MaQD). Experimental results show that our quantization method can be achieved
with minimal accuracy degradation.

                                        <span>  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) endeavors to adjust models trained on a
source domain to perform well on a target domain without requiring additional
annotations. In the context of domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which
tackles UDA for dense prediction, the goal is to circumvent the need for costly
pixel-level annotations. Typically, various prevailing methods baseline rely on
constructing intermediate domains via cross-domain mixed sampling techniques to
mitigate the performance decline caused by domain gaps. However, such
approaches generate synthetic data that diverge from real-world distributions,
potentially leading the model astray from the true target distribution. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel auxiliary task called Guidance
Training. This task facilitates the effective utilization of cross-domain mixed
sampling techniques while mitigating distribution shifts from the real world.
Specifically, Guidance Training guides the model to extract and reconstruct the
target-domain feature distribution from mixed data, followed by decoding the
reconstructed target-domain features to make pseudo-label predictions.
Importantly, integrating Guidance Training incurs minimal training overhead and
imposes no additional inference burden. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach by integrating it with existing methods, consistently improving
performance. The implementation will be available at

learning, traditionally studied in the context of discriminative models, to
generative models. We specifically focus on image synthesis personalization
tasks. The primary challenge in conducting active learning on generative models
lies in the open-ended nature of querying, which differs from the closed form
of querying in discriminative models that typically target a single concept. We
introduce the concept of anchor directions to transform the querying process
into a semi-open problem. We propose a direction-based uncertainty sampling
strategy to enable generative active learning and tackle the
exploitation-exploration dilemma. Extensive experiments are conducted to
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that an open-source
model can achieve superior performance compared to closed-source models
developed by large companies, such as Google's StyleDrop. The source code is

representation space using only unlabeled data. This challenging problem
requires accurately estimating the similarity between data points, which is
used to supervise a deep network. For this purpose, we propose to model the
high-dimensional data manifold using a piecewise-linear approximation, with
each low-dimensional linear piece approximating the data manifold in a small
neighborhood of a point. These neighborhoods are used to estimate similarity
between data points. We empirically show that this similarity estimate
correlates better with the ground truth than the similarity estimates of
current state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that proxies, commonly used
in supervised metric learning, can be used to model the piecewise-linear
manifold in an unsupervised setting, helping improve performance. Our method
outperforms existing unsupervised metric learning approaches on standard
zero-shot image retrieval benchmarks.

transitioned from single-modality to multi-modal fusion, posing new challenges
for existing forgery detection algorithms. In this paper, we propose AVT2-DWF,
the Audio-Visual dual Transformers grounded in Dynamic Weight Fusion, which
aims to amplify both intra- and cross-modal forgery cues, thereby enhancing
detection capabilities. AVT2-DWF adopts a dual-stage approach to capture both
spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of facial expressions. This is
achieved through a face transformer with an n-frame-wise tokenization strategy
encoder and an audio transformer encoder. Subsequently, it uses multi-modal
conversion with dynamic weight fusion to address the challenge of heterogeneous
information fusion between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on
DeepfakeTIMIT, FakeAVCeleb, and DFDC datasets indicate that AVT2-DWF achieves
state-of-the-art performance intra- and cross-dataset Deepfake detection. Code

representations for various downstream tasks, with a primary focus on semantic
tasks. However, its application in geometric tasks remains underexplored,
partially due to the absence of a standardized evaluation method for geometric
representations. To address this gap, we introduce a new pose-estimation
benchmark for assessing SSL geometric representations, which demands training
without semantic or pose labels and achieving proficiency in both semantic and
geometric downstream tasks. On this benchmark, we study enhancing SSL geometric
representations without sacrificing semantic classification accuracy. We find
that leveraging mid-layer representations improves pose-estimation performance
by 10-20%. Further, we introduce an unsupervised trajectory-regularization
loss, which improves performance by an additional 4% and improves
generalization ability on out-of-distribution data. We hope the proposed
benchmark and methods offer new insights and improvements in self-supervised
geometric representation learning.

utilization of score distillation methods: they make use of the pre-trained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling via the diffusion model
training objective. However, such an approach inevitably results in the use of
random timesteps at each update, which increases the variance of the gradient
and ultimately prolongs the optimization process. In this paper, we propose to
enhance the text-to-3D optimization by leveraging the T2I diffusion prior in
the generative sampling process with a predetermined timestep schedule. To this
end, we interpret text-to3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image
translation problem, and propose a solution by approximating the probability
flow. By leveraging the proposed novel optimization algorithm, we design
DreamFlow, a practical three-stage coarseto-fine text-to-3D optimization
framework that enables fast generation of highquality and high-resolution
(i.e., 1024x1024) 3D contents. For example, we demonstrate that DreamFlow is 5
times faster than the existing state-of-the-art text-to-3D method, while
producing more photorealistic 3D contents. Visit our project page

research attention, most existing text-driven motion generators are generally
only designed to generate motion sequences in a blank background. While this is
the case, in practice, human beings naturally perform their motions in 3D
scenes, rather than in a blank background. Considering this, we here aim to
perform scene-aware text-drive motion generation instead. Yet, intuitively
training a separate scene-aware motion generator in a supervised way can
require a large amount of motion samples to be troublesomely collected and
annotated in a large scale of different 3D scenes. To handle this task rather
in a relatively convenient manner, in this paper, we propose a novel
GPT-connect framework. In GPT-connect, we enable scene-aware motion sequences
to be generated directly utilizing the existing blank-background human motion
generator, via leveraging ChatGPT to connect the existing motion generator with
the 3D scene in a totally training-free manner. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed framework.

                                        <span>  There has been a significant progress in text conditional image generation
models. Recent advancements in this field depend not only on improvements in
model structures, but also vast quantities of text-image paired datasets.
However, creating these kinds of datasets is very costly and requires a
substantial amount of labor. Famous face datasets don't have corresponding text
captions, making it difficult to develop text conditional image generation
models on these datasets. Some research has focused on developing text to image
generation models using only images without text captions. Here, we propose
CLIP-VQDiffusion, which leverage the pretrained CLIP model to provide
multimodal text-image representations and strong image generation capabilities.
On the FFHQ dataset, our model outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods
by 4.4% in clipscore and generated very realistic images even when the text was
both in and out of distribution. The pretrained models and codes will soon be
available at https://github.com/INFINIQ-AI1/CLIPVQDiffusion

                                        <span>  Recent progress in pre-trained diffusion models and 3D generation have
spurred interest in 4D content creation. However, achieving high-fidelity 4D
generation with spatial-temporal consistency remains a challenge. In this work,
we propose STAG4D, a novel framework that combines pre-trained diffusion models
with dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity 4D generation. Drawing
inspiration from 3D generation techniques, we utilize a multi-view diffusion
model to initialize multi-view images anchoring on the input video frames,
where the video can be either real-world captured or generated by a video
diffusion model. To ensure the temporal consistency of the multi-view sequence
initialization, we introduce a simple yet effective fusion strategy to leverage
the first frame as a temporal anchor in the self-attention computation. With
the almost consistent multi-view sequences, we then apply the score
distillation sampling to optimize the 4D Gaussian point cloud. The 4D Gaussian
spatting is specially crafted for the generation task, where an adaptive
densification strategy is proposed to mitigate the unstable Gaussian gradient
for robust optimization. Notably, the proposed pipeline does not require any
pre-training or fine-tuning of diffusion networks, offering a more accessible
and practical solution for the 4D generation task. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms prior 4D generation works in rendering
quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and generation robustness, setting a new
state-of-the-art for 4D generation from diverse inputs, including text, image,
and video.

motion of the articulated components, represent the geometry and mobility of
object parts, and create realistic models that reflect articulated objects in
the real world. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current
state-of-the-art in 3D modeling of articulated objects, with a specific focus
on the task of articulated part perception and articulated object creation

relevant literature from two perspectives: geometry processing and articulation
modeling. Through this survey, we highlight the substantial progress made in
these areas, outline the ongoing challenges, and identify gaps for future
research. Our survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers
and practitioners in computer vision and graphics, offering insights into the

the same old task for the first time. This intriguing phenomenon, discovered in
replay-based Class Incremental Learning (CIL), highlights the imbalanced
forgetting of learned classes, as their accuracy is similar before the
occurrence of catastrophic forgetting. This discovery remains previously
unidentified due to the reliance on average incremental accuracy as the
measurement for CIL, which assumes that the accuracy of classes within the same
task is similar. However, this assumption is invalid in the face of
catastrophic forgetting. Further empirical studies indicate that this
imbalanced forgetting is caused by conflicts in representation between
semantically similar old and new classes. These conflicts are rooted in the
data imbalance present in replay-based CIL methods. Building on these insights,
we propose CLass-Aware Disentanglement (CLAD) to predict the old classes that
are more likely to be forgotten and enhance their accuracy. Importantly, CLAD
can be seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAD consistently improves current replay-based methods,
resulting in performance gains of up to 2.56%.

uses 3D Gaussians as a scene representation. Our approach enables
interactive-time reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering from real-world
single-camera RGBD videos. To this end, we propose a novel effective strategy
for seeding new Gaussians for newly explored areas and their effective online
optimization that is independent of the scene size and thus scalable to larger
scenes. This is achieved by organizing the scene into sub-maps which are
independently optimized and do not need to be kept in memory. We further
accomplish frame-to-model camera tracking by minimizing photometric and
geometric losses between the input and rendered frames. The Gaussian
representation allows for high-quality photo-realistic real-time rendering of
real-world scenes. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates
competitive or superior performance in mapping, tracking, and rendering
compared to existing neural dense SLAM methods.

semantic edits. Videoshop allows users to use any editing software, including
Photoshop and generative inpainting, to modify the first frame; it
automatically propagates those changes, with semantic, spatial, and temporally
consistent motion, to the remaining frames. Unlike existing methods that enable
edits only through imprecise textual instructions, Videoshop allows users to
add or remove objects, semantically change objects, insert stock photos into
videos, etc. with fine-grained control over locations and appearance. We
achieve this through image-based video editing by inverting latents with noise
extrapolation, from which we generate videos conditioned on the edited image.
Videoshop produces higher quality edits against 6 baselines on 2 editing
benchmarks using 10 evaluation metrics.

video, with matching audio, from a large variety of conditioning signals.
VideoPoet employs a decoder-only transformer architecture that processes
multimodal inputs -- including images, videos, text, and audio. The training
protocol follows that of Large Language Models (LLMs), consisting of two
stages: pretraining and task-specific adaptation. During pretraining, VideoPoet
incorporates a mixture of multimodal generative objectives within an
autoregressive Transformer framework. The pretrained LLM serves as a foundation
that can be adapted for a range of video generation tasks. We present empirical
results demonstrating the model's state-of-the-art capabilities in zero-shot
video generation, specifically highlighting VideoPoet's ability to generate
high-fidelity motions. Project page: http://sites.research.google/videopoet/

                                        <span>  In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture
components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the
image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data
choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we
demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of
image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks,
compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the
image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has
substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of
comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we
build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, including both
dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in
pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised
fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to
large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced
in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot
chain-of-thought prompting.

potential towards a generic model for Earth Observation. Nevertheless, these
works primarily focus on a single modality without temporal and geo-context
modeling, hampering their capabilities for diverse tasks. In this study, we
present SkySense, a generic billion-scale model, pre-trained on a curated
multi-modal Remote Sensing Imagery (RSI) dataset with 21.5 million temporal
sequences. SkySense incorporates a factorized multi-modal spatiotemporal
encoder taking temporal sequences of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data as input. This encoder is pre-trained by our proposed Multi-Granularity
Contrastive Learning to learn representations across different modal and
spatial granularities. To further enhance the RSI representations by the
geo-context clue, we introduce Geo-Context Prototype Learning to learn
region-aware prototypes upon RSI's multi-modal spatiotemporal features. To our
best knowledge, SkySense is the largest Multi-Modal RSFM to date, whose modules
can be flexibly combined or used individually to accommodate various tasks. It
demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities on a thorough evaluation
encompassing 16 datasets over 7 tasks, from single- to multi-modal, static to
temporal, and classification to localization. SkySense surpasses 18 recent
RSFMs in all test scenarios. Specifically, it outperforms the latest models
such as GFM, SatLas and Scale-MAE by a large margin, i.e., 2.76%, 3.67% and
3.61% on average respectively. We will release the pre-trained weights to
facilitate future research and Earth Observation applications.

ordinary differential equations (ODEs), with the aim of obtaining an accurate
solution with as few number of function evaluations (NFE) as possible.
Recently, various fast samplers utilizing higher-order ODE solvers have emerged
and achieved better performance than the initial first-order one. However,
these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors,
which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g.,
around 5). In contrast, based on the geometric observation that each sampling
trajectory almost lies in a two-dimensional subspace embedded in the ambient
space, we propose Approximate MEan-Direction Solver (AMED-Solver) that
eliminates truncation errors by directly learning the mean direction for fast
diffusion sampling. Besides, our method can be easily used as a plugin to
further improve existing ODE-based samplers. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis with the resolution ranging from 32 to 512 demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. With only 5 NFE, we achieve 6.61 FID on CIFAR-10,
10.74 FID on ImageNet 64$\times$64, and 13.20 FID on LSUN Bedroom. Our code is

in various fields has achieved remarkable success. However, as the foundation
model for many downstream tasks, current MLLMs are composed of the well-known
Transformer network, which has a less efficient quadratic computation
complexity. To improve the efficiency of such basic models, we propose Cobra, a
linear computational complexity MLLM. Specifically, Cobra integrates the
efficient Mamba language model into the visual modality. Moreover, we explore
and study various modal fusion schemes to create an effective multi-modal
Mamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) Cobra achieves extremely
competitive performance with current computationally efficient state-of-the-art
methods, e.g., LLaVA-Phi, TinyLLaVA, and MobileVLM v2, and has faster speed due
to Cobra's linear sequential modeling. (2) Interestingly, the results of
closed-set challenging prediction benchmarks show that Cobra performs well in
overcoming visual illusions and spatial relationship judgments. (3) Notably,
Cobra even achieves comparable performance to LLaVA with about 43% of the
number of parameters. We will make all codes of Cobra open-source and hope that
the proposed method can facilitate future research on complexity problems in
MLLM. Our project page is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/cobravlm.

token's attention span to its nearest neighbors. This restriction,
parameterized by a window size and dilation factor, draws a spectrum of
possible attention patterns between linear projection and self attention.
Neighborhood attention, and more generally sliding window attention patterns,
have long been bounded by infrastructure, particularly in higher-rank spaces
(2-D and 3-D), calling for the development of custom kernels, which have been
limited in either functionality, or performance, if not both. In this work, we
first show that neighborhood attention can be represented as a batched GEMM
problem, similar to standard attention, and implement it for 1-D and 2-D
neighborhood attention. These kernels on average provide 895% and 272%
improvement in full precision latency compared to existing naive kernels for
1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention respectively. We find certain inherent
inefficiencies in all unfused neighborhood attention kernels that bound their
performance and lower-precision scalability. We also developed fused
neighborhood attention; an adaptation of fused dot-product attention kernels
that allow fine-grained control over attention across different spatial axes.
Known for reducing the quadratic time complexity of self attention to a linear
complexity, neighborhood attention can now enjoy a reduced and constant memory
footprint, and record-breaking half precision latency. We observe that our
fused kernels successfully circumvent some of the unavoidable inefficiencies in
unfused implementations. While our unfused GEMM-based kernels only improve half
precision performance compared to naive kernels by an average of 496% and 113%
in 1-D and 2-D problems respectively, our fused kernels improve naive kernels
by an average of 1607% and 581% in 1-D and 2-D problems respectively.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses an interesting yet challenging problem -- source-free
unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) for pinhole-to-panoramic semantic
segmentation -- given only a pinhole image-trained model (i.e., source) and
unlabeled panoramic images (i.e., target). Tackling this problem is nontrivial
due to the semantic mismatches, style discrepancies, and inevitable distortion
of panoramic images. To this end, we propose a novel method that utilizes
Tangent Projection (TP) as it has less distortion and meanwhile slits the
equirectangular projection (ERP) with a fixed FoV to mimic the pinhole images.
Both projections are shown effective in extracting knowledge from the source
model. However, the distinct projection discrepancies between source and target
domains impede the direct knowledge transfer; thus, we propose a panoramic
prototype adaptation module (PPAM) to integrate panoramic prototypes from the
extracted knowledge for adaptation. We then impose the loss constraints on both
predictions and prototypes and propose a cross-dual attention module (CDAM) at
the feature level to better align the spatial and channel characteristics
across the domains and projections. Both knowledge extraction and transfer
processes are synchronously updated to reach the best performance. Extensive
experiments on the synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including outdoor and
indoor scenarios, demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better
performance than prior SFUDA methods for pinhole-to-panoramic adaptation.

                                        <span>  Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision
architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense
pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution
pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to
hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on
low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural
choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions
significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and
slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for
efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The
key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during
training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local
interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between
tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the
high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this
strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary
embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and
it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We
apply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data.
First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with
2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. Second, we
confirm this result on the task of monocular depth prediction. Third, we
further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching
state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD
images with an order of magnitude faster inference than the best competitor.

                                        <span>  Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved exceptional
performance across various multi-modal tasks. However, the deployment of VLMs
necessitates substantial energy consumption and computational resources. Once
attackers maliciously induce high energy consumption and latency time
(energy-latency cost) during inference of VLMs, it will exhaust computational
resources. In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of
VLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We
find that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated
by maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose
verbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to
induce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference. Concretely, we design
three loss objectives. First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, where EOS token is a signal for VLMs to stop
generating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity
loss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the
diversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which
can break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. Furthermore, a
temporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance
these losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our verbose images can
increase the length of generated sequences by 7.87 times and 8.56 times
compared to original images on MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets, which presents
potential challenges for various applications. Our code is available at

                                        <span>  We propose residual denoising diffusion models (RDDM), a novel dual diffusion
process that decouples the traditional single denoising diffusion process into
residual diffusion and noise diffusion. This dual diffusion framework expands
the denoising-based diffusion models, initially uninterpretable for image
restoration, into a unified and interpretable model for both image generation
and restoration by introducing residuals. Specifically, our residual diffusion
represents directional diffusion from the target image to the degraded input
image and explicitly guides the reverse generation process for image
restoration, while noise diffusion represents random perturbations in the
diffusion process. The residual prioritizes certainty, while the noise
emphasizes diversity, enabling RDDM to effectively unify tasks with varying
certainty or diversity requirements, such as image generation and restoration.
We demonstrate that our sampling process is consistent with that of DDPM and
DDIM through coefficient transformation, and propose a partially
path-independent generation process to better understand the reverse process.
Notably, our RDDM enables a generic UNet, trained with only an L1 loss and a
batch size of 1, to compete with state-of-the-art image restoration methods. We
provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration,

urban areas, thanks to their very high spatial and spectral resolutions on a
wide spectral domain. While the spectral dimension of hyperspectral images is
highly informative of the chemical composition of the land surface, the use of
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to map the land cover has been
dramatically limited by the availability of training data. To cope with the
scarcity of annotations, semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques have
lately raised a lot of interest in the community. Yet, the publicly available
hyperspectral data sets commonly used to benchmark machine learning models are
not totally suited to evaluate their generalization performances due to one or
several of the following properties: a limited geographical coverage (which
does not reflect the spectral diversity in metropolitan areas), a small number
of land cover classes and a lack of appropriate standard train / test splits
for semi-supervised and self-supervised learning. Therefore, we release in this
paper the Toulouse Hyperspectral Data Set that stands out from other data sets
in the above-mentioned respects in order to meet key issues in spectral
representation learning and classification over large-scale hyperspectral
images with very few labeled pixels. Besides, we discuss and experiment
self-supervised techniques for spectral representation learning, including the
Masked Autoencoder, and establish a baseline for pixel-wise classification
achieving 85% overall accuracy and 77% F1 score. The Toulouse Hyperspectral
Data Set and our code are publicly available at

                                        <span>  Amodal Instance Segmentation (AIS) presents a challenging task as it involves
predicting both visible and occluded parts of objects within images. Existing
AIS methods rely on a bidirectional approach, encompassing both the transition
from amodal features to visible features (amodal-to-visible) and from visible
features to amodal features (visible-to-amodal). Our observation shows that the
utilization of amodal features through the amodal-to-visible can confuse the
visible features due to the extra information of occluded/hidden segments not
presented in visible display. Consequently, this compromised quality of visible
features during the subsequent visible-to-amodal transition. To tackle this
issue, we introduce ShapeFormer, a decoupled Transformer-based model with a
visible-to-amodal transition. It facilitates the explicit relationship between
output segmentations and avoids the need for amodal-to-visible transitions.
ShapeFormer comprises three key modules: (i) Visible-Occluding Mask Head for
predicting visible segmentation with occlusion awareness, (ii) Shape-Prior
Amodal Mask Head for predicting amodal and occluded masks, and (iii)
Category-Specific Shape Prior Retriever aims to provide shape prior knowledge.
Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies across various AIS
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ShapeFormer. The code is

                                        <span>  Current 3D stylization methods often assume static scenes, which violates the
dynamic nature of our real world. To address this limitation, we present
S-DyRF, a reference-based spatio-temporal stylization method for dynamic neural
radiance fields. However, stylizing dynamic 3D scenes is inherently challenging
due to the limited availability of stylized reference images along the temporal
axis. Our key insight lies in introducing additional temporal cues besides the
provided reference. To this end, we generate temporal pseudo-references from
the given stylized reference. These pseudo-references facilitate the
propagation of style information from the reference to the entire dynamic 3D
scene. For coarse style transfer, we enforce novel views and times to mimic the
style details present in pseudo-references at the feature level. To preserve
high-frequency details, we create a collection of stylized temporal pseudo-rays
from temporal pseudo-references. These pseudo-rays serve as detailed and
explicit stylization guidance for achieving fine style transfer. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method yields
plausible stylized results of space-time view synthesis on dynamic 3D scenes.

                                        <span>  Advanced diffusion-based Text-to-Image (T2I) models, such as the Stable
Diffusion Model, have made significant progress in generating diverse and
high-quality images using text prompts alone. However, when non-famous users
require personalized image generation for their identities (IDs), the T2I
models fail to accurately generate their ID-related images. The main problem is
that pre-trained T2I models do not learn the mapping between the new ID prompts
and their corresponding visual content. The previous methods either failed to
accurately fit the face region or lost the interactive generative ability with
other existing concepts in T2I models. In other words, they are unable to
generate T2I-aligned and semantic-fidelity images for the given prompts with
other concepts such as scenes (``Eiffel Tower''), actions (``holding a
basketball''), and facial attributes (``eyes closed''). In this paper, we focus
on inserting accurate and interactive ID embedding into the Stable Diffusion
Model for semantic-fidelity personalized generation. We address this challenge
from two perspectives: face-wise region fitting and semantic-fidelity token
optimization. Specifically, we first visualize the attention overfit problem
and propose a face-wise attention loss to fit the face region instead of
entangling ID-unrelated information, such as face layout and background. This
key trick significantly enhances the ID accuracy and interactive generative
ability with other existing concepts. Then, we optimize one ID representation
as multiple per-stage tokens where each token contains two disentangled
features. This expansion of the textual conditioning space improves
semantic-fidelity control. Extensive experiments validate that our results
exhibit superior ID accuracy, text-based manipulation ability, and
generalization compared to previous methods.

architectures usually by exploring a large and thus complex architecture search
space. To advance the architecture search, we present a graph diffusion-based
NAS approach that uses discrete conditional graph diffusion processes to

multi-conditioned classifier-free guidance approach applied to graph diffusion
networks to jointly impose constraints such as high accuracy and low hardware
latency. Unlike the related work, our method is completely differentiable and
requires only a single model training. In our evaluations, we show promising
results on six standard benchmarks, yielding novel and unique architectures at
a fast speed, i.e. less than 0.2 seconds per architecture. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the generalisability and efficiency of our method through
experiments on ImageNet dataset.

revolutionized content creation, empowering non-experts to generate stunning
images with unique styles. While promising, adding realistic motions into these
personalized images by text poses significant challenges in preserving distinct
styles, high-fidelity details, and achieving motion controllability by text. In
this paper, we present PIA, a Personalized Image Animator that excels in
aligning with condition images, achieving motion controllability by text, and
the compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning.
To achieve these goals, PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained
temporal alignment layers, allowing for the seamless transformation of any
personalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is
the introduction of the condition module, which utilizes the condition frame
and inter-frame affinity as input to transfer appearance information guided by
the affinity hint for individual frame synthesis in the latent space. This
design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related image alignment within
and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance.

simply a response to visual stimuli; rather, it hinges on the human capacity to

introduce FunQA, a challenging video question-answering (QA) dataset
specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the depth of video reasoning
based on counter-intuitive and fun videos. Unlike most video QA benchmarks
which focus on less surprising contexts, e.g., cooking or instructional videos,
FunQA covers three previously unexplored types of surprising videos: 1)
HumorQA, 2) CreativeQA, and 3) MagicQA. For each subset, we establish rigorous
QA tasks designed to assess the model's capability in counter-intuitive
timestamp localization, detailed video description, and reasoning around
counter-intuitiveness. We also pose higher-level tasks, such as attributing a
fitting and vivid title to the video and scoring the video creativity. In
total, the FunQA benchmark consists of 312K free-text QA pairs derived from
4.3K video clips, spanning a total of 24 video hours. Moreover, we propose
FunMentor, an agent designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that uses
multi-turn dialogues to enhance models' understanding of counter-intuitiveness.
Extensive experiments with existing VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of
FunMentor and reveal significant performance gaps for the FunQA videos across
spatial-temporal reasoning, visual-centered reasoning, and free-text
generation.

                                        <span>  In the classical tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, detection and tracking
are separately and sequentially conducted, and data association must be
properly performed to achieve satisfactory tracking performance. In this paper,
a new end-to-end multi-object tracking framework is proposed, which integrates
object detection and multi-object tracking into a single model. The proposed
tracking framework eliminates the complex data association process in the
classical TBD paradigm, and requires no additional training. Secondly, the
regression confidence of historical trajectories is investigated, and the
possible states of a trajectory (weak object or strong object) in the current
frame are predicted. Then, a confidence fusion module is designed to guide
non-maximum suppression for trajectories and detections to achieve ordered and
robust tracking. Thirdly, by integrating historical trajectory features, the
regression performance of the detector is enhanced, which better reflects the
occlusion and disappearance patterns of objects in real world. Lastly,
extensive experiments are conducted on the commonly used KITTI and Waymo
datasets. The results show that the proposed framework can achieve robust
tracking by using only a 2D detector and a 3D detector, and it is proven more
accurate than many of the state-of-the-art TBD-based multi-modal tracking
methods. The source codes of the proposed method are available at

                                        <span>  Sora is the first large-scale generalist video generation model that garnered
significant attention across society. Since its launch by OpenAI in February
2024, no other video generation models have paralleled {Sora}'s performance or
its capacity to support a broad spectrum of video generation tasks.
Additionally, there are only a few fully published video generation models,
with the majority being closed-source. To address this gap, this paper proposes
a new multi-agent framework Mora, which incorporates several advanced visual AI
agents to replicate generalist video generation demonstrated by Sora. In
particular, Mora can utilize multiple visual agents and successfully mimic
Sora's video generation capabilities in various tasks, such as (1)
text-to-video generation, (2) text-conditional image-to-video generation, (3)
extend generated videos, (4) video-to-video editing, (5) connect videos and (6)
simulate digital worlds. Our extensive experimental results show that Mora
achieves performance that is proximate to that of Sora in various tasks.
However, there exists an obvious performance gap between our work and Sora when
assessed holistically. In summary, we hope this project can guide the future
trajectory of video generation through collaborative AI agents.

                                        <span>  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) use multi-view images for 3D scene
representation, demonstrating remarkable performance. As one of the primary
sources of multi-view images, multi-camera systems encounter challenges such as
varying intrinsic parameters and frequent pose changes. Most previous
NeRF-based methods assume a unique camera and rarely consider multi-camera
scenarios. Besides, some NeRF methods that can optimize intrinsic and extrinsic
parameters still remain susceptible to suboptimal solutions when these
parameters are poor initialized. In this paper, we propose MC-NeRF, a method
that enables joint optimization of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters
alongside NeRF. The method also supports each image corresponding to
independent camera parameters. First, we tackle coupling issue and the
degenerate case that arise from the joint optimization between intrinsic and
extrinsic parameters. Second, based on the proposed solutions, we introduce an
efficient calibration image acquisition scheme for multi-camera systems,
including the design of calibration object. Finally, we present an end-to-end
network with training sequence that enables the estimation of intrinsic and
extrinsic parameters, along with the rendering network. Furthermore,
recognizing that most existing datasets are designed for a unique camera, we
construct a real multi-camera image acquisition system and create a
corresponding new dataset, which includes both simulated data and real-world
captured images. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method when each
image corresponds to different camera parameters. Specifically, we use
multi-cameras, each with different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in
real-world system, to achieve 3D scene representation without providing initial
poses.

                                        <span>  The long-tailed distribution problem in medical image analysis reflects a
high prevalence of common conditions and a low prevalence of rare ones, which
poses a significant challenge in developing a unified model capable of
identifying rare or novel tumor categories not encountered during training. In
this paper, we propose a new zero-shot pan-tumor segmentation framework (ZePT)
based on query-disentangling and self-prompting to segment unseen tumor
categories beyond the training set. ZePT disentangles the object queries into
two subsets and trains them in two stages. Initially, it learns a set of
fundamental queries for organ segmentation through an object-aware feature
grouping strategy, which gathers organ-level visual features. Subsequently, it
refines the other set of advanced queries that focus on the auto-generated
visual prompts for unseen tumor segmentation. Moreover, we introduce
query-knowledge alignment at the feature level to enhance each query's
discriminative representation and generalizability. Extensive experiments on
various tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate the performance superiority of
ZePT, which surpasses the previous counterparts and evidence the promising
ability for zero-shot tumor segmentation in real-world settings.

completion with a sufficient number of points, they often fail in scenarios
when a few points, e.g. tens of points, are observed. Surprisingly, via entropy
analysis, we find that even a few points, e.g. 64 points, could retain
substantial information to help recover the 3D shape of the object. To address
the challenge of shape completion with very sparse point clouds, we then
propose Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model, which contains a novel
dual-branch feature extractor for handling extremely sparse inputs, coupled
with an extensive branch for maximal point utilization with a saliency branch
for dynamic importance assignment. This model is further bolstered by a
two-stage revision network that refines both the extracted features and the
decoder output, enhancing the detail and authenticity of the completed point
cloud. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of recovering 3D shapes from
a few points. The proposed Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model outperforms
previous methods on both few-point inputs and many-point inputs, and shows good
generalizability to different object categories.

a key role in robotics, Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. Recent advancements in dense representation SLAM have highlighted
the potential of leveraging neural scene representation and 3D Gaussian
representation for high-fidelity spatial representation. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense representation SLAM approach with a fusion of Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (G-ICP) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). In contrast
to existing methods, we utilize a single Gaussian map for both tracking and
mapping, resulting in mutual benefits. Through the exchange of covariances
between tracking and mapping processes with scale alignment techniques, we
minimize redundant computations and achieve an efficient system. Additionally,
we enhance tracking accuracy and mapping quality through our keyframe selection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
showing an incredibly fast speed up to 107 FPS (for the entire system) and
superior quality of the reconstructed map.

                                        <span>  Object detection methods under known single degradations have been
extensively investigated. However, existing approaches require prior knowledge
of the degradation type and train a separate model for each, limiting their
practical applications in unpredictable environments. To address this
challenge, we propose a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompted adaptive enhancer,
CPA-Enhancer, for object detection under unknown degradations. Specifically,
CPA-Enhancer progressively adapts its enhancement strategy under the
step-by-step guidance of CoT prompts, that encode degradation-related
information. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first work that exploits
CoT prompting for object detection tasks. Overall, CPA-Enhancer is a
plug-and-play enhancement model that can be integrated into any generic
detectors to achieve substantial gains on degraded images, without knowing the
degradation type priorly. Experimental results demonstrate that CPA-Enhancer
not only sets the new state of the art for object detection but also boosts the
performance of other downstream vision tasks under unknown degradations.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation. However,
when leveraging this idea for video generation, we face significant challenges
in maintaining the consistency and continuity across video frames. This is
mainly caused by the lack of an effective framework to align frames of videos
with desired temporal features while preserving consistent semantic and
stochastic features. In this work, we propose a novel Sector-Shaped Diffusion
Model (S2DM) whose sector-shaped diffusion region is formed by a set of
ray-shaped reverse diffusion processes starting at the same noise point. S2DM
can generate a group of intrinsically related data sharing the same semantic
and stochastic features while varying on temporal features with appropriate
guided conditions. We apply S2DM to video generation tasks, and explore the use
of optical flow as temporal conditions. Our experimental results show that S2DM
outperforms many existing methods in the task of video generation without any
temporal-feature modelling modules. For text-to-video generation tasks where
temporal conditions are not explicitly given, we propose a two-stage generation
strategy which can decouple the generation of temporal features from
semantic-content features. We show that, without additional training, our model
integrated with another temporal conditions generative model can still achieve
comparable performance with existing works. Our results can be viewd at

                                        <span>  Background: Dental caries diagnosis requires the manual inspection of
diagnostic bitewing images of the patient, followed by a visual inspection and
probing of the identified dental pieces with potential lesions. Yet the use of
artificial intelligence, and in particular deep-learning, has the potential to
aid in the diagnosis by providing a quick and informative analysis of the
bitewing images.
  Methods: A dataset of 13,887 bitewings from the HUNT4 Oral Health Study were
annotated individually by six different experts, and used to train three
different object detection deep-learning architectures: RetinaNet (ResNet50),
YOLOv5 (M size), and EfficientDet (D0 and D1 sizes). A consensus dataset of 197
images, annotated jointly by the same six dentist, was used for evaluation. A
five-fold cross validation scheme was used to evaluate the performance of the
AI models.
  Results: he trained models show an increase in average precision and
F1-score, and decrease of false negative rate, with respect to the dental
clinicians. When compared against the dental clinicians, the YOLOv5 model shows
the largest improvement, reporting 0.647 mean average precision, 0.548 mean
F1-score, and 0.149 mean false negative rate. Whereas the best annotators on
each of these metrics reported 0.299, 0.495, and 0.164 respectively.
  Conclusion: Deep-learning models have shown the potential to assist dental
professionals in the diagnosis of caries. Yet, the task remains challenging due
to the artifacts natural to the bitewing images.

                                        <span>  In recent decades, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) has
gained significant interest in both academia and industry. It estimates camera
motion and reconstructs the environment concurrently using visual sensors on a
moving robot. However, conventional cameras are limited by hardware, including
motion blur and low dynamic range, which can negatively impact performance in
challenging scenarios like high-speed motion and high dynamic range
illumination. Recent studies have demonstrated that event cameras, a new type
of bio-inspired visual sensor, offer advantages such as high temporal
resolution, dynamic range, low power consumption, and low latency. This paper
presents a timely and comprehensive review of event-based vSLAM algorithms that
exploit the benefits of asynchronous and irregular event streams for
localization and mapping tasks. The review covers the working principle of
event cameras and various event representations for preprocessing event data.
It also categorizes event-based vSLAM methods into four main categories:
feature-based, direct, motion-compensation, and deep learning methods, with
detailed discussions and practical guidance for each approach. Furthermore, the
paper evaluates the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks,
highlighting current challenges and future opportunities in this emerging
research area. A public repository will be maintained to keep track of the

                                        <span>  Conventional tracking paradigm takes in instantaneous measurements such as
range and bearing, and produces object tracks across time. In applications such
as autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are
usually passed through a "virtual sensor" realized by a deep learning model, to
produce "measurements" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a
tracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are
accumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We
argue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information,
and therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal
information, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the
end of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called
MULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object,
a pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the
input buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly
used lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the
resulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not
only to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct
more sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by
the pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death
models. We have conducted preliminary training and experimentation using Waymo
Open Dataset, which shows the efficacy of our proposed method.

                                        <span>  Instruction tuning of Large Vision-language Models (LVLMs) has revolutionized
the development of versatile models with zero-shot generalization across a wide
range of downstream vision-language tasks. However, the diversity of training
tasks of different sources and formats would lead to inevitable task conflicts,
where different tasks conflict for the same set of model parameters, resulting
in sub-optimal instructionfollowing abilities. To address that, we propose the
Mixture of Clusterconditional LoRA Experts (MoCLE), a novel Mixture of Experts
(MoE) architecture designed to activate the task-customized model parameters
based on the instruction clusters. A separate universal expert is further
incorporated to improve generalization capabilities of MoCLE for novel
instructions. Extensive experiments on 11 zero-shot tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoCLE.

                                        <span>  Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with
significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising,
and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to
non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has
emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of
a network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited
these tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant
artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this
paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with
portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage
existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the
same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each
responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By
adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility
compared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require
separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses
the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level,
data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can
effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the
style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.

                                        <span>  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning
abilities, which, however, are also more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than
their LLM predecessors. Although still capable of detecting unsafe responses,
we observe that safety mechanisms of the pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs can be
easily bypassed due to the introduction of image features. To construct robust
MLLMs, we propose ECSO(Eyes Closed, Safety On), a novel training-free
protecting approach that exploits the inherent safety awareness of MLLMs, and
generates safer responses via adaptively transforming unsafe images into texts
to activate intrinsic safety mechanism of pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs.
Experiments on five state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs demonstrate that our ECSO
enhances model safety significantly (e.g., a 37.6% improvement on the
MM-SafetyBench (SD+OCR), and 71.3% on VLSafe for the LLaVA-1.5-7B), while
consistently maintaining utility results on common MLLM benchmarks.
Furthermore, we show that ECSO can be used as a data engine to generate
supervised-finetuning (SFT) data for MLLM alignment without extra human
intervention.

                                        <span>  Recently there has been a growing interest in category-level object pose and
size estimation, and prevailing methods commonly rely on single view RGB-D
images. However, one disadvantage of such methods is that they require accurate
depth maps which cannot be produced by consumer-grade sensors. Furthermore,
many practical real-world situations involve a moving camera that continuously
observes its surroundings, and the temporal information of the input video
streams is simply overlooked by single-view methods. We propose a novel
solution that makes use of RGB video streams. Our framework consists of three
modules: a scale-aware monocular dense SLAM solution, a lightweight object pose
predictor, and an object-level pose graph optimizer. The SLAM module utilizes a
video stream and additional scale-sensitive readings to estimate camera poses
and metric depth. The object pose predictor then generates canonical object
representations from RGB images. The object pose is estimated through geometric
registration of these canonical object representations with estimated object
depth points. All per-view estimates finally undergo optimization within a pose
graph, culminating in the output of robust and accurate canonical object poses.
Our experimental results demonstrate that when utilizing public dataset
sequences with high-quality depth information, the proposed method exhibits
comparable performance to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods. We also collect and
evaluate on new datasets containing depth maps of varying quality to further
quantitatively benchmark the proposed method alongside previous RGB-D based
methods. We demonstrate a significant advantage in scenarios where depth input
is absent or the quality of depth sensing is limited.

task in computer vision. In contrast to prior works that utilize deterministic
modeling paradigms, we employ a point cloud denoising diffusion model to
account for the probabilistic nature of this problem. In the core, we introduce
centroid-fixed dual-stream conditional diffusion for monocular hand-held object
reconstruction (D-SCo), tackling two predominant challenges. First, to avoid
the object centroid from deviating, we utilize a novel hand-constrained
centroid fixing paradigm, enhancing the stability of diffusion and reverse
processes and the precision of feature projection. Second, we introduce a
dual-stream denoiser to semantically and geometrically model hand-object
interactions with a novel unified hand-object semantic embedding, enhancing the
reconstruction performance of the hand-occluded region of the object.
Experiments on the synthetic ObMan dataset and three real-world datasets HO3D,
MOW and DexYCB demonstrate that our approach can surpass all other
state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be released.

capability of Augmented Reality. Notably, gaze behavior is driven by both
visual cues and audio signals during daily activities. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce the first model that leverages both the video and
audio modalities for egocentric gaze anticipation. Specifically, we propose a
Contrastive Spatial-Temporal Separable (CSTS) fusion approach that adopts two
modules to separately capture audio-visual correlations in spatial and temporal
dimensions, and applies a contrastive loss on the re-weighted audio-visual
features from fusion modules for representation learning. We conduct extensive
ablation studies and thorough analysis using two egocentric video datasets:
Ego4D and Aria, to validate our model design. We demonstrate the audio improves
the performance by +2.5% and +2.4% on the two datasets. Our model also
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art methods by at least +1.9% and +1.6%.
Moreover, we provide visualizations to show the gaze anticipation results and
provide additional insights into audio-visual representation learning. The code

and indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered
backgrounds. Meanwhile, diffusion models have shown appealing performance in
generating high-quality images from random noise with high indeterminacy
through step-by-step denoising. Inspired by their denoising capability, we
propose a novel diffusion-based framework (6D-Diff) to handle the noise and
indeterminacy in object pose estimation for better performance. In our
framework, to establish accurate 2D-3D correspondence, we formulate 2D
keypoints detection as a reverse diffusion (denoising) process. To facilitate
such a denoising process, we design a Mixture-of-Cauchy-based forward diffusion
process and condition the reverse process on the object features. Extensive
experiments on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework.

                                        <span>  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant breakthrough into
foundation models for computer vision, providing a large-scale image
segmentation model. However, despite SAM's zero-shot performance, its
segmentation masks lack fine-grained details, particularly in accurately
delineating object boundaries. We have high expectations regarding whether SAM,
as a foundation model, can be improved towards highly accurate object
segmentation, which is known as dichotomous image segmentation (DIS). To
address this issue, we propose DIS-SAM, which advances SAM towards DIS with
extremely accurate details. DIS-SAM is a framework specifically tailored for
highly accurate segmentation, maintaining SAM's promptable design. DIS-SAM
employs a two-stage approach, integrating SAM with a modified IS-Net dedicated
to DIS. Despite its simplicity, DIS-SAM demonstrates significantly enhanced
segmentation accuracy compared to SAM and HQ-SAM.

navigate to a specified object depicted by a goal image in an unexplored
environment.
  The main challenge of this task lies in identifying the target object from
different viewpoints while rejecting similar distractors.
  Existing ImageGoal Navigation methods usually adopt the simple
Exploration-Exploitation framework and ignore the identification of specific
instance during navigation.
  In this work, we propose to imitate the human behaviour of ``getting closer
to confirm" when distinguishing objects from a distance.
  Specifically, we design a new modular navigation framework named
Instance-aware Exploration-Verification-Exploitation (IEVE) for instance-level
image goal navigation.
  Our method allows for active switching among the exploration, verification,
and exploitation actions, thereby facilitating the agent in making reasonable
decisions under different situations.
  On the challenging HabitatMatterport 3D semantic (HM3D-SEM) dataset, our
method surpasses previous state-of-the-art work, with a classical segmentation
model (0.684 vs. 0.561 success) or a robust model (0.702 vs. 0.561 success)

on a variety of open-ended tasks, while recent research has also explored the
use of LLMs for multi-modal generation. In this study, we introduce mPLUG-Owl,
a novel training paradigm that equips LLMs with multi-modal abilities through
modularized learning of foundation LLM, a visual knowledge module, and a visual
abstractor module. This approach can support multiple modalities and facilitate
diverse unimodal and multimodal abilities through modality collaboration. The
training paradigm of mPLUG-Owl involves a two-stage method for aligning image
and text, which learns visual knowledge with the assistance of LLM while
maintaining and even improving the generation abilities of LLM. In the first
stage, the visual knowledge module and abstractor module are trained with a
frozen LLM module to align the image and text. In the second stage,
language-only and multi-modal supervised datasets are used to jointly fine-tune
a low-rank adaption (LoRA) module on LLM and the abstractor module by freezing
the visual knowledge module. We carefully build a visually-related instruction
evaluation set OwlEval. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing multi-modal models, demonstrating mPLUG-Owl's impressive instruction
and visual understanding ability, multi-turn conversation ability, and
knowledge reasoning ability. Besides, we observe some unexpected and exciting
abilities such as multi-image correlation and scene text understanding, which
makes it possible to leverage it for harder real scenarios, such as vision-only
document comprehension. Our code, pre-trained model, instruction-tuned models,

to train model identifying OOD samples, especially discovering challenging
outliers from auxiliary outliers dataset to improve OOD detection. However,
they may still face limitations in effectively distinguishing between the most
challenging OOD samples that are much like in-distribution (ID) data, i.e.,
\idlike samples. To this end, we propose a novel OOD detection framework that
discovers \idlike outliers using CLIP \cite{DBLP:conf/icml/RadfordKHRGASAM21}
from the vicinity space of the ID samples, thus helping to identify these most
challenging OOD samples. Then a prompt learning framework is proposed that
utilizes the identified \idlike outliers to further leverage the capabilities
of CLIP for OOD detection. Benefiting from the powerful CLIP, we only need a
small number of ID samples to learn the prompts of the model without exposing
other auxiliary outlier datasets. By focusing on the most challenging \idlike
OOD samples and elegantly exploiting the capabilities of CLIP, our method
achieves superior few-shot learning performance on various real-world image
datasets (e.g., in 4-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, our method
reduces the average FPR95 by 12.16\% and improves the average AUROC by 2.76\%,
compared to state-of-the-art methods). Code is available at

technologies and progressively expands across research and industry
communities. However, existing gait recognition methods heavily rely on
task-specific upstream driven by supervised learning to provide explicit gait
representations like silhouette sequences, which inevitably introduce expensive
annotation costs and potential error accumulation. Escaping from this trend,
this work explores effective gait representations based on the all-purpose
knowledge produced by task-agnostic Large Vision Models (LVMs) and proposes a
simple yet efficient gait framework, termed BigGait. Specifically, the Gait
Representation Extractor (GRE) within BigGait draws upon design principles from
established gait representations, effectively transforming all-purpose
knowledge into implicit gait representations without requiring third-party
supervision signals. Experiments on CCPG, CAISA-B* and SUSTech1K indicate that
BigGait significantly outperforms the previous methods in both within-domain
and cross-domain tasks in most cases, and provides a more practical paradigm
for learning the next-generation gait representation. Finally, we delve into
prospective challenges and promising directions in LVMs-based gait recognition,
aiming to inspire future work in this emerging topic. The source code is

varying scenes. To prevent interference of components in a wide enhancement
block, a refinement block utilizes a stacked architecture to accurately learn
obtained features. Also, a residual learning operation is embedded in the
refinement block to prevent long-term dependency problem. Finally, a
construction block is responsible for reconstructing high-quality images.
Designed heterogeneous architecture can not only facilitate richer structural
information, but also be lightweight, which is suitable for mobile digital
devices. Experimental results shows that our method is more competitive in
terms of performance and recovering time of image super-resolution and
complexity. The code of DSRNet can be obtained at

                                        <span>  With the continuous maturation and application of autonomous driving
technology, a systematic examination of open-source autonomous driving datasets
becomes instrumental in fostering the robust evolution of the industry
ecosystem. Current autonomous driving datasets can broadly be categorized into
two generations. The first-generation autonomous driving datasets are
characterized by relatively simpler sensor modalities, smaller data scale, and
is limited to perception-level tasks. KITTI, introduced in 2012, serves as a
prominent representative of this initial wave. In contrast, the
second-generation datasets exhibit heightened complexity in sensor modalities,
greater data scale and diversity, and an expansion of tasks from perception to
encompass prediction and control. Leading examples of the second generation
include nuScenes and Waymo, introduced around 2019. This comprehensive review,
conducted in collaboration with esteemed colleagues from both academia and
industry, systematically assesses over seventy open-source autonomous driving
datasets from domestic and international sources. It offers insights into
various aspects, such as the principles underlying the creation of high-quality
datasets, the pivotal role of data engine systems, and the utilization of
generative foundation models to facilitate scalable data generation.
Furthermore, this review undertakes an exhaustive analysis and discourse
regarding the characteristics and data scales that future third-generation
autonomous driving datasets should possess. It also delves into the scientific
and technical challenges that warrant resolution. These endeavors are pivotal
in advancing autonomous innovation and fostering technological enhancement in
critical domains. For further details, please refer to

                                        <span>  Remote sensing images pose distinct challenges for downstream tasks due to
their inherent complexity. While a considerable amount of research has been
dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic
segmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior
knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be
useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without
referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different
objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large
Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its
large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various
objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective
kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images.
Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art
scores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic
segmentation benchmarks. Our comprehensive analysis further validated the
significance of the identified priors and the effectiveness of LSKNet. The code
is available at https://github.com/zcablii/LSKNet.

                                        <span>  Recently, the remarkable advance of the Large Language Model (LLM) has
inspired researchers to transfer its extraordinary reasoning capability to both
vision and language data. However, the prevailing approaches primarily regard
the visual input as a prompt and focus exclusively on optimizing the text
generation process conditioned upon vision content by a frozen LLM. Such an
inequitable treatment of vision and language heavily constrains the model's
potential. In this paper, we break through this limitation by representing both
vision and language in a unified form. Specifically, we introduce a
well-designed visual tokenizer to translate the non-linguistic image into a
sequence of discrete tokens like a foreign language that LLM can read. The
resulting visual tokens encompass high-level semantics worthy of a word and
also support dynamic sequence length varying from the image. Coped with this
tokenizer, the presented foundation model called LaVIT can handle both image
and text indiscriminately under the same generative learning paradigm. This
unification empowers LaVIT to serve as an impressive generalist interface to
understand and generate multi-modal content simultaneously. Extensive
experiments further showcase that it outperforms the existing models by a large
margin on massive vision-language tasks. Our code and models are available at
https://github.com/jy0205/LaVIT.

viewpoint serves as a key step towards efficient skill transfer. In this paper,
we introduce a novel problem -- egocentric action frame generation. The goal is
to synthesize an image depicting an action in the user's context (i.e., action
frame) by conditioning on a user prompt and an input egocentric image. Notably,
existing egocentric action datasets lack the detailed annotations that describe
the execution of actions. Additionally, existing diffusion-based image
manipulation models are sub-optimal in controlling the state transition of an
action in egocentric image pixel space because of the domain gap. To this end,
we propose to Learn EGOcentric (LEGO) action frame generation via visual
instruction tuning. First, we introduce a prompt enhancement scheme to generate
enriched action descriptions from a visual large language model (VLLM) by
visual instruction tuning. Then we propose a novel method to leverage image and
text embeddings from the VLLM as additional conditioning to improve the
performance of a diffusion model. We validate our model on two egocentric
datasets -- Ego4D and Epic-Kitchens. Our experiments show substantial
improvement over prior image manipulation models in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluation. We also conduct detailed ablation studies and analysis
to provide insights in our method. More details of the dataset and code are
available on the website (https://bolinlai.github.io/Lego_EgoActGen/).

                                        <span>  $\textbf{Background}$: Generalizability of AI colonoscopy algorithms is
important for wider adoption in clinical practice. However, current techniques
for evaluating performance on unseen data require expensive and time-intensive
labels.
  $\textbf{Methods}$: We use a "Masked Siamese Network" (MSN) to identify novel
phenomena in unseen data and predict polyp detector performance. MSN is trained
to predict masked out regions of polyp images, without any labels. We test
MSN's ability to be trained on data only from Israel and detect unseen
techniques, narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromendoscoy (CE), on colonoscopes
from Japan (354 videos, 128 hours). We also test MSN's ability to predict
performance of Computer Aided Detection (CADe) of polyps on colonoscopies from
both countries, even though MSN is not trained on data from Japan.
  $\textbf{Results}$: MSN correctly identifies NBI and CE as less similar to
Israel whitelight than Japan whitelight (bootstrapped z-test, |z| > 496, p <
10^-8 for both) using the label-free Frechet distance. MSN detects NBI with 99%
accuracy, predicts CE better than our heuristic (90% vs 79% accuracy) despite
being trained only on whitelight, and is the only method that is robust to
noisy labels. MSN predicts CADe polyp detector performance on in-domain Israel
and out-of-domain Japan colonoscopies (r=0.79, 0.37 respectively). With few
examples of Japan detector performance to train on, MSN prediction of Japan
performance improves (r=0.56).
  $\textbf{Conclusion}$: Our technique can identify distribution shifts in
clinical data and can predict CADe detector performance on unseen data, without
labels. Our self-supervised approach can aid in detecting when data in practice
is different from training, such as between hospitals or data has meaningfully
shifted from training. MSN has potential for application to medical image
domains beyond colonoscopy.

elements along with a given content, such as an e-commerce product image. In
this paper, we argue that the current layout generation approaches suffer from
the limited training data for the high-dimensional layout structure. We show
that a simple retrieval augmentation can significantly improve the generation
quality. Our model, which is named Retrieval-Augmented Layout Transformer
(RALF), retrieves nearest neighbor layout examples based on an input image and
feeds these results into an autoregressive generator. Our model can apply
retrieval augmentation to various controllable generation tasks and yield
high-quality layouts within a unified architecture. Our extensive experiments
show that RALF successfully generates content-aware layouts in both constrained
and unconstrained settings and significantly outperforms the baselines.

                                        <span>  Creating personalized hand avatars is important to offer a realistic
experience to users on AR / VR platforms. While most prior studies focused on
reconstructing 3D hand shapes, some recent work has tackled the reconstruction
of hand textures on top of shapes. However, these methods are often limited to
capturing pixels on the visible side of a hand, requiring diverse views of the
hand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands), which is the
first end-to-end trainable method for relightable, pose-free texture
reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image, by
three novel components: 1) bi-directional (left $\leftrightarrow$ right)
texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands, 2)
utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery, and 3) the
overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture
of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and
albedo image from an input image, then reconstructs the texture of both hands
through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor.
In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methods
quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Recently, Vision Transformer has achieved great success in recovering missing
details in low-resolution sequences, i.e., the video super-resolution (VSR)
task. Despite its superiority in VSR accuracy, the heavy computational burden
as well as the large memory footprint hinder the deployment of
Transformer-based VSR models on constrained devices. In this paper, we address
the above issue by proposing a novel feature-level masked processing framework:
VSR with Masked Intra and inter frame Attention (MIA-VSR). The core of MIA-VSR
is leveraging feature-level temporal continuity between adjacent frames to
reduce redundant computations and make more rational use of previously enhanced
SR features. Concretely, we propose an intra-frame and inter-frame attention
block which takes the respective roles of past features and input features into
consideration and only exploits previously enhanced features to provide
supplementary information. In addition, an adaptive block-wise mask prediction
module is developed to skip unimportant computations according to feature
similarity between adjacent frames. We conduct detailed ablation studies to
validate our contributions and compare the proposed method with recent
state-of-the-art VSR approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that
MIA-VSR improves the memory and computation efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods, without trading off PSNR accuracy. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Despite their ability to generate high-resolution and diverse images from
text prompts, text-to-image diffusion models often suffer from slow iterative
sampling processes. Model distillation is one of the most effective directions
to accelerate these models. However, previous distillation methods fail to
retain the generation quality while requiring a significant amount of images
for training, either from real data or synthetically generated by the teacher
model. In response to this limitation, we present a novel image-free
distillation scheme named $\textbf{SwiftBrush}$. Drawing inspiration from
text-to-3D synthesis, in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the
input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a
specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth, our approach
re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image
model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a
single inference step. In spite of its simplicity, our model stands as one of
the first one-step text-to-image generators that can produce images of
comparable quality to Stable Diffusion without reliance on any training image
data. Remarkably, SwiftBrush achieves an FID score of $\textbf{16.67}$ and a
CLIP score of $\textbf{0.29}$ on the COCO-30K benchmark, achieving competitive
results or even substantially surpassing existing state-of-the-art distillation
techniques.

                                        <span>  Human fingerprints serve as one unique and powerful characteristic for each
person, from which policemen can recognize the identity. Similar to humans,
many natural bodies and intrinsic mechanical qualities can also be uniquely
identified from surface characteristics. To measure the elasto-plastic
properties of one material, one formally sharp indenter is pushed into the
measured body under constant force and retracted, leaving a unique residual
imprint of the minute size from several micrometers to nanometers. However, one
great challenge is how to map the optical image of this residual imprint into
the real wanted mechanical properties, \ie, the tensile force curve. In this
paper, we propose a novel method to use multi-fidelity neural networks (MFNN)
to solve this inverse problem. We first build up the NN model via pure
simulation data, and then bridge the sim-to-real gap via transfer learning.
Considering the difficulty of collecting real experimental data, we use NN to
dig out the unknown physics and also implant the known physics into the
transfer learning framework, thus highly improving the model stability and
decreasing the data requirement. The final constructed model only needs
three-shot calibration of real materials. We tested the final model across 20
real materials and achieved satisfying accuracy. This work serves as one great
example of applying machine learning into scientific research, especially under
the constraints of data limitation and fidelity variance.

                                        <span>  Oriented object detection has been developed rapidly in the past few years,
where rotation equivariance is crucial for detectors to predict rotated boxes.
It is expected that the prediction can maintain the corresponding rotation when
objects rotate, but severe mutation in angular prediction is sometimes observed
when objects rotate near the boundary angle, which is well-known boundary
discontinuity problem. The problem has been long believed to be caused by the
sharp loss increase at the angular boundary, and widely used joint-optim
IoU-like methods deal with this problem by loss-smoothing. However, we
experimentally find that even state-of-the-art IoU-like methods actually fail
to solve the problem. On further analysis, we find that the key to solution
lies in encoding mode of the smoothing function rather than in joint or
independent optimization. In existing IoU-like methods, the model essentially
attempts to fit the angular relationship between box and object, where the
break point at angular boundary makes the predictions highly unstable.To deal
with this issue, we propose a dual-optimization paradigm for angles. We
decouple reversibility and joint-optim from single smoothing function into two
distinct entities, which for the first time achieves the objectives of both
correcting angular boundary and blending angle with other parameters.Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets show that boundary discontinuity problem is
well-addressed. Moreover, typical IoU-like methods are improved to the same
level without obvious performance gap. The code is available at

effectiveness in addressing downstream image recognition tasks. However, recent
works revealed that the CLIP model can be implanted with a downstream-oriented
backdoor. On downstream tasks, one victim model performs well on clean samples
but predicts a specific target class whenever a specific trigger is present.
For injecting a backdoor, existing attacks depend on a large amount of
additional data to maliciously fine-tune the entire pre-trained CLIP model,
which makes them inapplicable to data-limited scenarios. In this work,
motivated by the recent success of learnable prompts, we address this problem
by injecting a backdoor into the CLIP model in the prompt learning stage. Our
method named BadCLIP is built on a novel and effective mechanism in backdoor
attacks on CLIP, i.e., influencing both the image and text encoders with the
trigger. It consists of a learnable trigger applied to images and a
trigger-aware context generator, such that the trigger can change text features
via trigger-aware prompts, resulting in a powerful and generalizable attack.
Extensive experiments conducted on 11 datasets verify that the clean accuracy
of BadCLIP is similar to those of advanced prompt learning methods and the
attack success rate is higher than 99% in most cases. BadCLIP is also
generalizable to unseen classes, and shows a strong generalization capability
under cross-dataset and cross-domain settings.

                                        <span>  Human-centric perception tasks, e.g., pedestrian detection, skeleton-based
action recognition, and pose estimation, have wide industrial applications,
such as metaverse and sports analysis. There is a recent surge to develop
human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric
perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved
success, they did not explore 3D and vision-language tasks for human-centric
and required task-specific finetuning. These limitations restrict their
application to more downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems,
we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable
of addressing 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks
without task-specific finetuning. The key to achieving this is condensing
various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete
representations, e.g., languages, and the other for continuous representations,
e.g., location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked
into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation
enables Hulk to treat diverse human-centric tasks as modality translation,
integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
of Hulk on 12 benchmarks covering 8 human-centric tasks demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
11 benchmarks. The code is available on https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Hulk.

                                        <span>  Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in scene text
detection, which mainly contain two steps: text kernel segmentation and
expansion. However, the segmentation process only considers each pixel
independently, and the expansion process is difficult to achieve a favorable
accuracy-speed trade-off. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and
Boundary-guided Network (CBN) to tackle these problems. In CBN, a basic text
detector is firstly used to predict initial segmentation results. Then, we
propose a context-aware module to enhance text kernel feature representations,
which considers both global and local contexts. Finally, we introduce a
boundary-guided module to expand enhanced text kernels adaptively with only the
pixels on the contours, which not only obtains accurate text boundaries but
also keeps high speed, especially on high-resolution output maps. In
particular, with a lightweight backbone, the basic detector equipped with our
proposed CBN achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks,
and our proposed CBN can be plugged into several segmentation-based methods.

of both image-to-text and text-to-image generation. However, the success is
typically limited to English, leaving other languages largely behind. Building
a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the
low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale,
high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective
training paradigm for training large multimodal models in non-English
languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot
zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong
multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only
image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a (quasi)-zero-shot
manner, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages.
Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in
image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art
(open-source) performance in Chinese. To facilitate future research, we

single image, a video, or a random noise. This problem has been formulated as
modeling of an auto-regressive generation, i.e., to regress past frames to
decode future frames. However, such unidirectional generation is highly prone
to motion drifting over time, generating unrealistic human animation with
significant artifacts such as appearance distortion. We claim that
bidirectional temporal modeling enforces temporal coherence on a generative
network by largely suppressing the motion ambiguity of human appearance. To
prove our claim, we design a novel human animation framework using a denoising
diffusion model: a neural network learns to generate the image of a person by
denoising temporal Gaussian noises whose intermediate results are
cross-conditioned bidirectionally between consecutive frames. In the
experiments, our method demonstrates strong performance compared to existing
unidirectional approaches with realistic temporal coherence.

control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video
that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods
have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet
the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel
training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary
steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.
InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an
existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion
and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing
image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.
Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support
novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,
subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by
previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing
image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature
injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source
video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the
previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human
preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high
success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to
seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such
compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse
user demands.

                                        <span>  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) stands as one of the critical
challenges in robot navigation. A SLAM system often consists of a front-end
component for motion estimation and a back-end system for eliminating
estimation drifts. Recent advancements suggest that data-driven methods are
highly effective for front-end tasks, while geometry-based methods continue to
be essential in the back-end processes. However, such a decoupled paradigm
between the data-driven front-end and geometry-based back-end can lead to
sub-optimal performance, consequently reducing the system's capabilities and
generalization potential. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel
self-supervised imperative learning framework, named imperative SLAM (iSLAM),
which fosters reciprocal correction between the front-end and back-end, thus
enhancing performance without necessitating any external supervision.
Specifically, we formulate the SLAM problem as a bilevel optimization so that
the front-end and back-end are bidirectionally connected. As a result, the
front-end model can learn global geometric knowledge obtained through pose
graph optimization by back-propagating the residuals from the back-end
component. We showcase the effectiveness of this new framework through an
application of stereo-inertial SLAM. The experiments show that the iSLAM
training strategy achieves an accuracy improvement of 22% on average over a
baseline model. To the best of our knowledge, iSLAM is the first SLAM system
showing that the front-end and back-end components can mutually correct each
other in a self-supervised manner.

                                        <span>  Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has made significant recent strides
by transferring knowledge from a teacher neural network to a student neural
network without accessing the original data. Nonetheless, existing approaches
encounter a significant challenge when attempting to generate samples from
random noise inputs, which inherently lack meaningful information.
Consequently, these models struggle to effectively map this noise to the
ground-truth sample distribution, resulting in prolonging training times and
low-quality outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel Noisy Layer Generation
method (NAYER) which relocates the random source from the input to a noisy
layer and utilizes the meaningful constant label-text embedding (LTE) as the
input. LTE is generated by using the language model once, and then it is stored
in memory for all subsequent training processes. The significance of LTE lies
in its ability to contain substantial meaningful inter-class information,
enabling the generation of high-quality samples with only a few training steps.
Simultaneously, the noisy layer plays a key role in addressing the issue of
diversity in sample generation by preventing the model from overemphasizing the
constrained label information. By reinitializing the noisy layer in each
iteration, we aim to facilitate the generation of diverse samples while still
retaining the method's efficiency, thanks to the ease of learning provided by
LTE. Experiments carried out on multiple datasets demonstrate that our NAYER
not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods but also achieves speeds 5 to
15 times faster than previous approaches. The code is available at

to promote the training efficiency and effectiveness, has achieved great
success in vision recognition of natural domains and shown promise in medical
imaging diagnosis for the Chest X-Rays (CXRs). However, current works mainly
pay attention to the exploration on single dataset of CXRs, which locks the
potential of this powerful paradigm on larger hybrid of multi-source CXRs
datasets. We identify that although blending samples from the diverse sources
offers the advantages to improve the model generalization, it is still
challenging to maintain the consistent superiority for the task of each source
due to the existing heterogeneity among sources. To handle this dilemma, we
design a Conquer-and-Divide pre-training framework, termed as UniChest, aiming
to make full use of the collaboration benefit of multiple sources of CXRs while
reducing the negative influence of the source heterogeneity. Specially, the
``Conquer" stage in UniChest encourages the model to sufficiently capture
multi-source common patterns, and the ``Divide" stage helps squeeze
personalized patterns into different small experts (query networks). We conduct
thorough experiments on many benchmarks, e.g., ChestX-ray14, CheXpert,
Vindr-CXR, Shenzhen, Open-I and SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax, verifying the
effectiveness of UniChest over a range of baselines, and release our codes and

                                        <span>  Learning from videos is an emerging research area that enables robots to
acquire skills from human demonstrations, such as procedural videos. To do
this, video-language models must be able to obtain structured understandings,
such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions
and skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel domains. In pursuit
of this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1)
step recognition and (2) intra-video retrieval over a dataset of temporally
segmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk
recordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to make use of:
(1) out-of-domain visual information; (2) a high temporal context window; and
(3) multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) domains. This departs from existing
benchmarks for procedural video understanding, which typically deal with short
context lengths and can be solved with a single modality. Spacewalk-18, with
its inherent multimodal and long-form complexity, exposes the high difficulty
of task recognition and segmentation. We find that state-of-the-art methods
perform poorly on our benchmark, but improvements can be obtained by
incorporating information from longer-range temporal context across different
modalities. Our experiments underscore the need to develop new approaches to
these tasks. Data, model, and code will be released at

schemes. Extensive evaluation on the MuAViC benchmark shows the strength of
XLAVS-R on downstream audio-visual speech recognition and translation tasks,
where it outperforms the previous state of the art by up to 18.5% WER and 4.7
BLEU given noisy AV inputs, and enables strong zero-shot audio-visual ability
with audio-only fine-tuning.

                                        <span>  The state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors leveraging deep neural networks
exhibit impressive recognition performance. Nonetheless, this advantage is
accompanied by a significant carbon footprint. This is mainly due to the use of
high-performance computing with accelerators and high training time. Studies
show that average deep NLP model produces around 626k lbs of
CO\textsubscript{2} which is equivalent to five times of average US car
emission at its lifetime. This is certainly a massive threat to the
environment. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel framework
for audio deepfake detection that can be seamlessly trained using standard CPU
resources. Our proposed framework utilizes off-the-shelve self-supervised
learning (SSL) based models which are pre-trained and available in public
repositories. In contrast to existing methods that fine-tune SSL models and
employ additional deep neural networks for downstream tasks, we exploit
classical machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and shallow
neural networks using the SSL embeddings extracted using the pre-trained model.
Our approach shows competitive results compared to the commonly used
high-carbon footprint approaches. In experiments with the ASVspoof 2019 LA
dataset, we achieve a 0.90\% equal error rate (EER) with less than 1k trainable
model parameters. To encourage further research in this direction and support
reproducible results, the Python code will be made publicly accessible

received as much focus as other components. Moreover, the robustness of speaker
diarization across various datasets hasn't been explored when the development
and evaluation data are from different domains. To bridge this gap, this study
thoroughly examines spectral clustering for both same-domain and cross-domain
speaker diarization. Our extensive experiments on two widely used corpora, AMI
and DIHARD, reveal the performance trend of speaker diarization in the presence
of domain mismatch. We observe that the performance difference between two
different domain conditions can be attributed to the role of spectral
clustering. In particular, keeping other modules unchanged, we show that
differences in optimal tuning parameters as well as speaker count estimation
originates due to the mismatch. This study opens several future directions for
speaker diarization research.

is an end-to-end neural model for automatic speaker segmentation and labeling.
It achieves the capability to handle flexible number of speakers by estimating
the number of attractors. EEND-EDA, however, struggles to accurately capture
local speaker dynamics. This work proposes an auxiliary loss that aims to guide
the Transformer encoders at the lower layer of EEND-EDA model to enhance the
effect of self-attention modules using speaker activity information. The
results evaluated on public dataset Mini LibriSpeech, demonstrates the
effectiveness of the work, reducing Diarization Error Rate from 30.95% to
28.17%. We will release the source code on GitHub to allow further research and
reproducibility.

                                        <span>  The state-of-the-art approach for semi-supervised anomalous sound detection
is to first learn an embedding space by using auxiliary classification tasks
based on meta information or self-supervised learning and then estimate the
distribution of normal data. In this work, AdaProj a novel loss function is
presented. In contrast to commonly used angular margin losses, which project
data of each class as close as possible to their corresponding class centers,
AdaProj learns to project data onto class-specific subspaces. By doing so, the
resulting distributions of embeddings belonging to normal data are not required
to be as restrictive as other loss functions allowing a more detailed view on
the data. In experiments conducted on the DCASE2022 and DCASE2023 datasets, it
is shown that using AdaProj to learn an embedding space significantly
outperforms other commonly used loss functions and results in a
state-of-the-art performance on the DCASE2023 dataset.

                                        <span>  Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for enabling computers to
understand the emotions conveyed in human communication. With recent
advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has
significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires
specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically
determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)
is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study
presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network
(SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature
supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance.
  While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations
independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN
operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose
limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best
layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms
conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER
results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the
IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.

learning (ML) experts from various audio domains. There are several valuable
audio-driven ML tasks, from speech emotion recognition to audio event
detection, but the community is sparse compared to other ML areas, e.g.,
computer vision or natural language processing. A major limitation with audio
is the available data; with audio being a time-dependent modality, high-quality
data collection is time-consuming and costly, making it challenging for
academic groups to apply their often state-of-the-art strategies to a larger,
more generalizable dataset. In this short white paper, to encourage researchers
with limited access to large-datasets, the organizers first outline several
open-source datasets that are available to the community, and for the duration
of the workshop are making several propriety datasets available. Namely, three
vocal datasets, Hume-Prosody, Hume-VocalBurst, an acted emotional speech
dataset Modulate-Sonata, and an in-game streamer dataset Modulate-Stream. We
outline the current baselines on these datasets but encourage researchers from
across audio to utilize them outside of the initial baseline tasks.

(EMI) Estimation task within the context of the 6th Workshop and Competition on
Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild. Our approach leverages the Wav2Vec 2.0
framework, pre-trained on a comprehensive podcast dataset, to extract a broad
range of audio features encompassing both linguistic and paralinguistic
elements. We enhance feature representation through a fusion technique that
integrates individual features with a global mean vector, introducing global
contextual insights into our analysis. Additionally, we incorporate a
pre-trained valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) module from the Wav2Vec 2.0 model.
Our fusion employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for efficient
temporal analysis of audio data. Utilizing only the provided audio data, our
approach demonstrates significant improvements over the established baseline.

                                        <span>  Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities
to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of
downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic
approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more
computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this
paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation
method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies
its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time
Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of
the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension.
Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the
efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask
separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of
the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior
SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the
number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency
domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary
time-domain counterparts.

speaker verification challenge based on cry sounds. We released more than 6
hours of manually segmented cry sounds from 786 newborns for academic use,
aiming to encourage research in infant cry analysis. The inaugural public
competition attracted 59 participants, 11 of whom improved the baseline
performance. The top-performing system achieved a significant improvement
scoring 25.8% equal error rate, which is still far from the performance of

there is room for further research on this dataset, potentially extending
beyond the verification task.

representation learning. In this paper, we propose a pipeline of contrastive
language-audio pretraining to develop an audio representation by combining
audio data with natural language descriptions. To accomplish this target, we
first release LAION-Audio-630K, a large collection of 633,526 audio-text pairs
from different data sources. Second, we construct a contrastive language-audio
pretraining model by considering different audio encoders and text encoders. We
incorporate the feature fusion mechanism and keyword-to-caption augmentation
into the model design to further enable the model to process audio inputs of
variable lengths and enhance the performance. Third, we perform comprehensive
experiments to evaluate our model across three tasks: text-to-audio retrieval,
zero-shot audio classification, and supervised audio classification. The
results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in
text-to-audio retrieval task. In audio classification tasks, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setting and is able to obtain
performance comparable to models' results in the non-zero-shot setting.
LAION-Audio-630K and the proposed model are both available to the public.

trigger phrase followed by the user command. To make interactions with the
assistant more intuitive, we explore whether it is feasible to drop the
requirement that users must begin each command with a trigger phrase. We
explore this task in three ways: First, we train classifiers using only
acoustic information obtained from the audio waveform. Second, we take the
decoder outputs of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, such as 1-best
hypotheses, as input features to a large language model (LLM). Finally, we
explore a multimodal system that combines acoustic and lexical features, as
well as ASR decoder signals in an LLM. Using multimodal information yields
relative equal-error-rate improvements over text-only and audio-only models of
up to 39% and 61%. Increasing the size of the LLM and training with low-rank
adaption leads to further relative EER reductions of up to 18% on our dataset.

which are frequent in realistic environments. Augmenting these systems with
visual signals has the potential to improve robustness to noise. However,
audio-visual (AV) data is only available in limited amounts and for fewer
languages than audio-only resources. To address this gap, we present XLAVS-R, a
cross-lingual audio-visual speech representation model for noise-robust speech
recognition and translation in over 100 languages. It is designed to maximize
the benefits of limited multilingual AV pre-training data, by building on top
of audio-only multilingual pre-training and simplifying existing pre-training
schemes. Extensive evaluation on the MuAViC benchmark shows the strength of
XLAVS-R on downstream audio-visual speech recognition and translation tasks,
where it outperforms the previous state of the art by up to 18.5% WER and 4.7
BLEU given noisy AV inputs, and enables strong zero-shot audio-visual ability
with audio-only fine-tuning.

is an end-to-end neural model for automatic speaker segmentation and labeling.
It achieves the capability to handle flexible number of speakers by estimating
the number of attractors. EEND-EDA, however, struggles to accurately capture
local speaker dynamics. This work proposes an auxiliary loss that aims to guide
the Transformer encoders at the lower layer of EEND-EDA model to enhance the
effect of self-attention modules using speaker activity information. The
results evaluated on public dataset Mini LibriSpeech, demonstrates the
effectiveness of the work, reducing Diarization Error Rate from 30.95% to
28.17%. We will release the source code on GitHub to allow further research and

                                        <span>  Target Sound Extraction (TSE) focuses on the problem of separating sources of
interest, indicated by a user's cue, from the input mixture. Most existing
solutions operate in an offline fashion and are not suited to the low-latency
causal processing constraints imposed by applications in live-streamed content
such as augmented hearing. We introduce a family of context-aware low-latency
causal TSE models suitable for real-time processing. First, we explore the
utility of context by providing the TSE model with oracle information about
what sound classes make up the input mixture, where the objective of the model
is to extract one or more sources of interest indicated by the user. Since the
practical applications of oracle models are limited due to their assumptions,
we introduce a composite multi-task training objective involving separation and
classification losses. Our evaluation involving single- and multi-source
extraction shows the benefit of using context information in the model either
by means of providing full context or via the proposed multi-task training loss
without the need for full context information. Specifically, we show that our
proposed model outperforms size- and latency-matched Waveformer, a
state-of-the-art model for real-time TSE.

                                        <span>  The state-of-the-art approach for semi-supervised anomalous sound detection
is to first learn an embedding space by using auxiliary classification tasks
based on meta information or self-supervised learning and then estimate the
distribution of normal data. In this work, AdaProj a novel loss function is
presented. In contrast to commonly used angular margin losses, which project
data of each class as close as possible to their corresponding class centers,
AdaProj learns to project data onto class-specific subspaces. By doing so, the
resulting distributions of embeddings belonging to normal data are not required
to be as restrictive as other loss functions allowing a more detailed view on
the data. In experiments conducted on the DCASE2022 and DCASE2023 datasets, it
is shown that using AdaProj to learn an embedding space significantly
outperforms other commonly used loss functions and results in a
state-of-the-art performance on the DCASE2023 dataset.

                                        <span>  Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for enabling computers to
understand the emotions conveyed in human communication. With recent
advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has
significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires
specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically
determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)
is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study
presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network
(SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature
supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance.
  While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations
independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN
operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose
limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best
layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms
conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER
results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the
IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.

learning (ML) experts from various audio domains. There are several valuable
audio-driven ML tasks, from speech emotion recognition to audio event
detection, but the community is sparse compared to other ML areas, e.g.,
computer vision or natural language processing. A major limitation with audio
is the available data; with audio being a time-dependent modality, high-quality
data collection is time-consuming and costly, making it challenging for
academic groups to apply their often state-of-the-art strategies to a larger,
more generalizable dataset. In this short white paper, to encourage researchers
with limited access to large-datasets, the organizers first outline several
open-source datasets that are available to the community, and for the duration
of the workshop are making several propriety datasets available. Namely, three
vocal datasets, Hume-Prosody, Hume-VocalBurst, an acted emotional speech
dataset Modulate-Sonata, and an in-game streamer dataset Modulate-Stream. We
outline the current baselines on these datasets but encourage researchers from
across audio to utilize them outside of the initial baseline tasks.

exhibit impressive recognition performance. Nonetheless, this advantage is
accompanied by a significant carbon footprint. This is mainly due to the use of
high-performance computing with accelerators and high training time. Studies
show that average deep NLP model produces around 626k lbs of
CO\textsubscript{2} which is equivalent to five times of average US car
emission at its lifetime. This is certainly a massive threat to the
environment. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel framework
for audio deepfake detection that can be seamlessly trained using standard CPU
resources. Our proposed framework utilizes off-the-shelve self-supervised
learning (SSL) based models which are pre-trained and available in public
repositories. In contrast to existing methods that fine-tune SSL models and
employ additional deep neural networks for downstream tasks, we exploit
classical machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and shallow
neural networks using the SSL embeddings extracted using the pre-trained model.
Our approach shows competitive results compared to the commonly used
high-carbon footprint approaches. In experiments with the ASVspoof 2019 LA
dataset, we achieve a 0.90\% equal error rate (EER) with less than 1k trainable
model parameters. To encourage further research in this direction and support
reproducible results, the Python code will be made publicly accessible

of domain mismatch. We observe that the performance difference between two
different domain conditions can be attributed to the role of spectral
clustering. In particular, keeping other modules unchanged, we show that
differences in optimal tuning parameters as well as speaker count estimation
originates due to the mismatch. This study opens several future directions for
speaker diarization research.

                                        <span>  With the advent of generative audio features, there is an increasing need for
rapid evaluation of their impact on speech intelligibility. Beyond the existing
laboratory measures, which are expensive and do not scale well, there has been
comparatively little work on crowdsourced assessment of intelligibility.
Standards and recommendations are yet to be defined, and publicly available
multilingual test materials are lacking. In response to this challenge, we
propose an approach for a crowdsourced intelligibility assessment. We detail
the test design, the collection and public release of the multilingual speech
data, and the results of our early experiments.

Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild. Our approach leverages the Wav2Vec 2.0
framework, pre-trained on a comprehensive podcast dataset, to extract a broad
range of audio features encompassing both linguistic and paralinguistic
elements. We enhance feature representation through a fusion technique that
integrates individual features with a global mean vector, introducing global
contextual insights into our analysis. Additionally, we incorporate a
pre-trained valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) module from the Wav2Vec 2.0 model.
Our fusion employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for efficient

                                        <span>  Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities
to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of
downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic
approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more
computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this
paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation
method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies
its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time
Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of
the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension.
Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the
efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask
separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of
the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior
SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the
number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency
domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary
time-domain counterparts.

hours of manually segmented cry sounds from 786 newborns for academic use,
aiming to encourage research in infant cry analysis. The inaugural public

language-audio pretraining to develop an audio representation by combining
audio data with natural language descriptions. To accomplish this target, we
first release LAION-Audio-630K, a large collection of 633,526 audio-text pairs
from different data sources. Second, we construct a contrastive language-audio
pretraining model by considering different audio encoders and text encoders. We
incorporate the feature fusion mechanism and keyword-to-caption augmentation
into the model design to further enable the model to process audio inputs of
variable lengths and enhance the performance. Third, we perform comprehensive
experiments to evaluate our model across three tasks: text-to-audio retrieval,
zero-shot audio classification, and supervised audio classification. The
results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in
text-to-audio retrieval task. In audio classification tasks, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setting and is able to obtain
performance comparable to models' results in the non-zero-shot setting.
LAION-Audio-630K and the proposed model are both available to the public.

of multiple objects in complex scenes from a single RGB-D image. Despite
notable advancements in single object 3D shape completion, high-quality
reconstructions in highly cluttered real-world multi-object scenes remains a
challenge. To address this issue, we propose OctMAE, an architecture that
leverages an Octree U-Net and a latent 3D MAE to achieve high-quality and near
real-time multi-object shape completion through both local and global geometric
reasoning. Because a na\"ive 3D MAE can be computationally intractable and
memory intensive even in the latent space, we introduce a novel occlusion
masking strategy and adopt 3D rotary embeddings, which significantly improves
the runtime and shape completion quality. To generalize to a wide range of
objects in diverse scenes, we create a large-scale photorealistic dataset,
featuring a diverse set of 12K 3D object models from the Objaverse dataset
which are rendered in multi-object scenes with physics-based positioning. Our
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art on both synthetic and

                                        <span>  We propose MVSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting model
learned from sparse multi-view images. To accurately localize the Gaussian
centers, we propose to build a cost volume representation via plane sweeping in
the 3D space, where the cross-view feature similarities stored in the cost
volume can provide valuable geometry cues to the estimation of depth. We learn
the Gaussian primitives' opacities, covariances, and spherical harmonics
coefficients jointly with the Gaussian centers while only relying on
photometric supervision. We demonstrate the importance of the cost volume
representation in learning feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models via extensive
experimental evaluations. On the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks,
our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest feed-forward
inference speed (22 fps). Compared to the latest state-of-the-art method
pixelSplat, our model uses $10\times $ fewer parameters and infers more than
$2\times$ faster while providing higher appearance and geometry quality as well
as better cross-dataset generalization.

                                        <span>  We present a simple self-supervised method to enhance the performance of ViT
features for dense downstream tasks. Our Lightweight Feature Transform (LiFT)
is a straightforward and compact postprocessing network that can be applied to
enhance the features of any pre-trained ViT backbone. LiFT is fast and easy to
train with a self-supervised objective, and it boosts the density of ViT
features for minimal extra inference cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
LiFT can be applied with approaches that use additional task-specific
downstream modules, as we integrate LiFT with ViTDet for COCO detection and
segmentation. Despite the simplicity of LiFT, we find that it is not simply
learning a more complex version of bilinear interpolation. Instead, our LiFT
training protocol leads to several desirable emergent properties that benefit
ViT features in dense downstream tasks. This includes greater scale invariance
for features, and better object boundary maps. By simply training LiFT for a
few epochs, we show improved performance on keypoint correspondence, detection,
segmentation, and object discovery tasks. Overall, LiFT provides an easy way to
unlock the benefits of denser feature arrays for a fraction of the
computational cost. For more details, refer to our project page at

autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose ODTFormer, a Transformer-based
model to address both obstacle detection and tracking problems. For the
detection task, our approach leverages deformable attention to construct a 3D
cost volume, which is decoded progressively in the form of voxel occupancy
grids. We further track the obstacles by matching the voxels between
consecutive frames. The entire model can be optimized in an end-to-end manner.
Through extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and KITTI benchmarks, our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in the obstacle detection task. We also
report comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art obstacle tracking models while
requiring only a fraction of their computation cost, typically ten-fold to
twenty-fold less. The code and model weights will be publicly released.

                                        <span>  The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
garnered unparalleled attention, due to their superior performance in visual
contexts. However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remain
insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to
incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which
potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the
input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math
benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We
meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with
diagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by
human annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of
information content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in
total. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how
much MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning.
In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a
fine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True
or False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and
then score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the
intermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark
may provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project

Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based
Generative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data
generation and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance. By
employing SGMs as an initial solution for DSB, our approach capitalizes on the
strengths of both frameworks, ensuring a more efficient training process and
improving the performance of SGM. We also propose a reparameterization

network's fitting capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluations confirm
the effectiveness of the simplified DSB, demonstrating its significant

multi-modal LLMs. Despite supporting long context-lengths, their effectiveness
in handling long-term information gradually declines with input length. This
becomes critical, especially in applications such as long-form video
understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Language Repository (LangRepo) for
LLMs, that maintains concise and structured information as an interpretable
(i.e., all-textual) representation. Our repository is updated iteratively based
on multi-scale video chunks. We introduce write and read operations that focus
on pruning redundancies in text, and extracting information at various temporal
scales. The proposed framework is evaluated on zero-shot visual
question-answering benchmarks including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA and
NExT-GQA, showing state-of-the-art performance at its scale. Our code is

                                        <span>  We introduce GRM, a large-scale reconstructor capable of recovering a 3D
asset from sparse-view images in around 0.1s. GRM is a feed-forward
transformer-based model that efficiently incorporates multi-view information to
translate the input pixels into pixel-aligned Gaussians, which are unprojected
to create a set of densely distributed 3D Gaussians representing a scene.
Together, our transformer architecture and the use of 3D Gaussians unlock a
scalable and efficient reconstruction framework. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternatives regarding both
reconstruction quality and efficiency. We also showcase the potential of GRM in
generative tasks, i.e., text-to-3D and image-to-3D, by integrating it with
existing multi-view diffusion models. Our project website is at:

                                        <span>  3D decomposition/segmentation still remains a challenge as large-scale 3D
annotated data is not readily available. Contemporary approaches typically
leverage 2D machine-generated segments, integrating them for 3D consistency.
While the majority of these methods are based on NeRFs, they face a potential
weakness that the instance/semantic embedding features derive from independent
MLPs, thus preventing the segmentation network from learning the geometric
details of the objects directly through radiance and density. In this paper, we
propose ClusteringSDF, a novel approach to achieve both segmentation and
reconstruction in 3D via the neural implicit surface representation,
specifically Signal Distance Function (SDF), where the segmentation rendering
is directly integrated with the volume rendering of neural implicit surfaces.
Although based on ObjectSDF++, ClusteringSDF no longer requires the
ground-truth segments for supervision while maintaining the capability of
reconstructing individual object surfaces, but purely with the noisy and
inconsistent labels from pre-trained models.As the core of ClusteringSDF, we
introduce a high-efficient clustering mechanism for lifting the 2D labels to 3D
and the experimental results on the challenging scenes from ScanNet and Replica
datasets show that ClusteringSDF can achieve competitive performance compared
against the state-of-the-art with significantly reduced training time.

semantic edits. Videoshop allows users to use any editing software, including
Photoshop and generative inpainting, to modify the first frame; it
automatically propagates those changes, with semantic, spatial, and temporally
consistent motion, to the remaining frames. Unlike existing methods that enable
edits only through imprecise textual instructions, Videoshop allows users to
add or remove objects, semantically change objects, insert stock photos into
videos, etc. with fine-grained control over locations and appearance. We
achieve this through image-based video editing by inverting latents with noise
extrapolation, from which we generate videos conditioned on the edited image.
Videoshop produces higher quality edits against 6 baselines on 2 editing
benchmarks using 10 evaluation metrics.

                                        <span>  Self-supervised representation learning has been highly promising for
histopathology image analysis with numerous approaches leveraging their
patient-slide-patch hierarchy to learn better representations. In this paper,
we explore how the combination of domain specific natural language information
with such hierarchical visual representations can benefit rich representation
learning for medical image tasks. Building on automated language description
generation for features visible in histopathology images, we present a novel
language-tied self-supervised learning framework, Hierarchical Language-tied
Self-Supervision (HLSS) for histopathology images. We explore contrastive
objectives and granular language description based text alignment at multiple
hierarchies to inject language modality information into the visual
representations. Our resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
two medical imaging benchmarks, OpenSRH and TCGA datasets. Our framework also
provides better interpretability with our language aligned representation
space. Code is available at https://github.com/Hasindri/HLSS.

                                        <span>  In the image acquisition process, various forms of degradation, including
noise, haze, and rain, are frequently introduced. These degradations typically
arise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient
conditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous
specialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific
type of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant
attention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model
without requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,
these methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the
distinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To
address this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network
based on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that different degradation types impact the image content on
different frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each
restoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency
information from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra
of the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a
bidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency
components. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input
for a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves
adaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands
according to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different
image restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion
deblurring, and low-light image enhancement. Our code is available at

However, current text-to-3D methods often generate 3D results that do not align
well with human preferences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
framework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-to-3D models from
human preference feedback. To begin with, we collect 25k expert comparisons
based on a systematic annotation pipeline including rating and ranking. Then,
we build Reward3D -- the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference
reward model to effectively encode human preferences. Building upon the 3D
reward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3D
Feedback Learning (DreamFL), a direct tuning algorithm to optimize the
multi-view diffusion models with a redefined scorer. Grounded by theoretical
proof and extensive experiment comparisons, our DreamReward successfully
generates high-fidelity and 3D consistent results with significant boosts in
prompt alignment with human intention. Our results demonstrate the great
potential for learning from human feedback to improve text-to-3D models.

proposed new sampling strategy, which we call Time Reversal Fusion, that fuses
the temporally forward and backward denoising paths conditioned on the start
and end frame, respectively. The fused path results in a video that smoothly
connects the two frames, generating inbetweening of faithful subject motion,
novel views of static scenes, and seamless video looping when the two bounding
frames are identical. We curate a diverse evaluation dataset of image pairs and
compare against the closest existing methods. We find that Time Reversal Fusion
outperforms related work on all subtasks, exhibiting the ability to generate
complex motions and 3D-consistent views guided by bounded frames. See project

                                        <span>  We present T-Rex2, a highly practical model for open-set object detection.
Previous open-set object detection methods relying on text prompts effectively
encapsulate the abstract concept of common objects, but struggle with rare or
complex object representation due to data scarcity and descriptive limitations.
Conversely, visual prompts excel in depicting novel objects through concrete
visual examples, but fall short in conveying the abstract concept of objects as
effectively as text prompts. Recognizing the complementary strengths and
weaknesses of both text and visual prompts, we introduce T-Rex2 that synergizes
both prompts within a single model through contrastive learning. T-Rex2 accepts
inputs in diverse formats, including text prompts, visual prompts, and the
combination of both, so that it can handle different scenarios by switching
between the two prompt modalities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
T-Rex2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot object detection capabilities across a
wide spectrum of scenarios. We show that text prompts and visual prompts can
benefit from each other within the synergy, which is essential to cover massive
and complicated real-world scenarios and pave the way towards generic object
detection. Model API is now available at

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have unlocked powerful
image manipulation capabilities. However, applying these methods to real images
necessitates the inversion of the images into the domain of the pretrained
diffusion model. Achieving faithful inversion remains a challenge, particularly
for more recent models trained to generate images with a small number of
denoising steps. In this work, we introduce an inversion method with a high
quality-to-operation ratio, enhancing reconstruction accuracy without
increasing the number of operations. Building on reversing the diffusion
sampling process, our method employs an iterative renoising mechanism at each
inversion sampling step. This mechanism refines the approximation of a
predicted point along the forward diffusion trajectory, by iteratively applying
the pretrained diffusion model, and averaging these predictions. We evaluate
the performance of our ReNoise technique using various sampling algorithms and
models, including recent accelerated diffusion models. Through comprehensive
evaluations and comparisons, we show its effectiveness in terms of both
accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we confirm that our method preserves
editability by demonstrating text-driven image editing on real images.

capabilities in understanding and generating textual descriptions for visual
content. However, these models lack an understanding of user-specific concepts.
In this work, we take a first step toward the personalization of VLMs, enabling
them to learn and reason over user-provided concepts. For example, we explore
whether these models can learn to recognize you in an image and communicate
what you are doing, tailoring the model to reflect your personal experiences
and relationships. To effectively recognize a variety of user-specific
concepts, we augment the VLM with external concept heads that function as
toggles for the model, enabling the VLM to identify the presence of specific
target concepts in a given image. Having recognized the concept, we learn a new
concept embedding in the intermediate feature space of the VLM. This embedding
is tasked with guiding the language model to naturally integrate the target
concept in its generated response. We apply our technique to BLIP-2 and LLaVA
for personalized image captioning and further show its applicability for
personalized visual question-answering. Our experiments demonstrate our ability
to generalize to unseen images of learned concepts while preserving the model
behavior on unrelated inputs.

limited to textual output, PSALM incorporates a mask decoder and a
well-designed input schema to handle a variety of segmentation tasks. This
schema includes images, task instructions, conditional prompts, and mask
tokens, which enable the model to generate and classify segmentation masks
effectively. The flexible design of PSALM supports joint training across
multiple datasets and tasks, leading to improved performance and task
generalization. PSALM achieves superior results on several benchmarks, such as
RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg, COCO Panoptic Segmentation, and COCO-Interactive,
and further exhibits zero-shot capabilities on unseen tasks, such as
open-vocabulary segmentation, generalized referring expression segmentation and
video object segmentation, making a significant step towards a GPT moment in
computer vision. Through extensive experiments, PSALM demonstrates its
potential to transform the domain of image segmentation, leveraging the robust

problem, where an off-the-shelf global descriptor is commonly designed in
image-based and LiDAR-based modalities. However, it is non-trivial to perform
accurate image-LiDAR global place recognition since extracting consistent and
robust global descriptors from different domains (2D images and 3D point
clouds) is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Voxel-Cross-Pixel (VXP) approach, which establishes voxel and pixel
correspondences in a self-supervised manner and brings them into a shared
feature space. Specifically, VXP is trained in a two-stage manner that first
explicitly exploits local feature correspondences and enforces similarity of
global descriptors. Extensive experiments on the three benchmarks (Oxford
RobotCar, ViViD++ and KITTI) demonstrate our method surpasses the
state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval by a large margin.

                                        <span>  Image stylization involves manipulating the visual appearance and texture
(style) of an image while preserving its underlying objects, structures, and
concepts (content). The separation of style and content is essential for
manipulating the image's style independently from its content, ensuring a
harmonious and visually pleasing result. Achieving this separation requires a
deep understanding of both the visual and semantic characteristics of images,
often necessitating the training of specialized models or employing heavy
optimization. In this paper, we introduce B-LoRA, a method that leverages LoRA
(Low-Rank Adaptation) to implicitly separate the style and content components
of a single image, facilitating various image stylization tasks. By analyzing
the architecture of SDXL combined with LoRA, we find that jointly learning the
LoRA weights of two specific blocks (referred to as B-LoRAs) achieves
style-content separation that cannot be achieved by training each B-LoRA
independently. Consolidating the training into only two blocks and separating
style and content allows for significantly improving style manipulation and
overcoming overfitting issues often associated with model fine-tuning. Once
trained, the two B-LoRAs can be used as independent components to allow various
image stylization tasks, including image style transfer, text-based image
stylization, consistent style generation, and style-content mixing.

                                        <span>  Localizing predefined 3D keypoints in a 2D image is an effective way to
establish 3D-2D correspondences for 6DoF object pose estimation. However,
unreliable localization results of invisible keypoints degrade the quality of
correspondences. In this paper, we address this issue by localizing the
important keypoints in terms of visibility. Since keypoint visibility
information is currently missing in dataset collection process, we propose an
efficient way to generate binary visibility labels from available object-level
annotations, for keypoints of both asymmetric objects and symmetric objects. We
further derive real-valued visibility-aware importance from binary labels based
on PageRank algorithm. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our
visibility-aware importance, we construct VAPO (Visibility-Aware POse
estimator) by integrating the visibility-aware importance with a
state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm, along with additional positional
encoding. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular pose estimation
benchmarks including Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-V. The results show
that, VAPO improves both the keypoint correspondences and final estimated
poses, and clearly achieves state-of-the-art performances.

                                        <span>  We propose Gaussian Frosting, a novel mesh-based representation for
high-quality rendering and editing of complex 3D effects in real-time. Our
approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes
a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose
first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building
and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around
the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the
surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it
resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the
thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to
enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their
parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our
representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well
as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that
it outperforms existing surface-based approaches. We will release our code and
a web-based viewer as additional contributions. Our project page is the

                                        <span>  While Transformers have rapidly gained popularity in various computer vision
applications, post-hoc explanations of their internal mechanisms remain largely
unexplored. Vision Transformers extract visual information by representing
image regions as transformed tokens and integrating them via attention weights.
However, existing post-hoc explanation methods merely consider these attention
weights, neglecting crucial information from the transformed tokens, which
fails to accurately illustrate the rationales behind the models' predictions.
To incorporate the influence of token transformation into interpretation, we
propose TokenTM, a novel post-hoc explanation method that utilizes our
introduced measurement of token transformation effects. Specifically, we
quantify token transformation effects by measuring changes in token lengths and
correlations in their directions pre- and post-transformation. Moreover, we
develop initialization and aggregation rules to integrate both attention
weights and token transformation effects across all layers, capturing holistic
token contributions throughout the model. Experimental results on segmentation
and perturbation tests demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TokenTM
compared to state-of-the-art Vision Transformer explanation methods.

video, with the powerful localized semantic features learned by a pre-trained
DINO-ViT model. Specifically, our framework simultaneously adopts DINO's
features to fit to the motion observations of the test video, while training a
tracker that directly leverages the refined features. The entire framework is
trained end-to-end using a combination of self-supervised losses, and
regularization that allows us to retain and benefit from DINO's semantic prior.
Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art
results on known benchmarks. DINO-tracker significantly outperforms
self-supervised methods and is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised
trackers, while outperforming them in challenging cases of tracking under
long-term occlusions.

                                        <span>  The application of data augmentation for deep learning (DL) methods plays an
important role in achieving state-of-the-art results in supervised,
semi-supervised, and self-supervised image classification. In particular,
channel transformations (e.g., solarize, grayscale, brightness adjustments) are
integrated into data augmentation pipelines for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks. However, contradicting beliefs exist about their proper
applications to RS images. A common point of critique is that the application
of channel augmentation techniques may lead to physically inconsistent spectral
data (i.e., pixel signatures). To shed light on the open debate, we propose an
approach to estimate whether a channel augmentation technique affects the
physical information of RS images. To this end, the proposed approach estimates
a score that measures the alignment of a pixel signature within a time series
that can be naturally subject to deviations caused by factors such as
acquisition conditions or phenological states of vegetation. We compare the
scores associated with original and augmented pixel signatures to evaluate the
physical consistency. Experimental results on a multi-label image
classification task show that channel augmentations yielding a score that
exceeds the expected deviation of original pixel signatures can not improve the
performance of a baseline model trained without augmentation.

wild is the scarcity of <3D shape, 2D image>-paired data from real-world
environments. Inspired by remarkable achievements via domain randomization, we
propose ObjectDR which synthesizes such paired data via a random simulation of
visual variations in object appearances and backgrounds. Our data synthesis
framework exploits a conditional generative model (e.g., ControlNet) to
generate images conforming to spatial conditions such as 2.5D sketches, which
are obtainable through a rendering process of 3D shapes from object collections
(e.g., Objaverse-XL). To simulate diverse variations while preserving object
silhouettes embedded in spatial conditions, we also introduce a disentangled
framework which leverages an initial object guidance. After synthesizing a wide
range of data, we pre-train a model on them so that it learns to capture a
domain-invariant geometry prior which is consistent across various domains. We
validate its effectiveness by substantially improving 3D shape reconstruction
models on a real-world benchmark. In a scale-up evaluation, our pre-training
achieves 23.6% superior results compared with the pre-training on high-quality
computer graphics renderings.

                                        <span>  Sign language recognition (SLR) has recently achieved a breakthrough in
performance thanks to deep neural networks trained on large annotated sign
datasets. Of the many different sign languages, these annotated datasets are
only available for a select few. Since acquiring gloss-level labels on sign
language videos is difficult, learning by transferring knowledge from existing
annotated sources is useful for recognition in under-resourced sign languages.
This study provides a publicly available cross-dataset transfer learning
benchmark from two existing public Turkish SLR datasets. We use a temporal
graph convolution-based sign language recognition approach to evaluate five
supervised transfer learning approaches and experiment with closed-set and
partial-set cross-dataset transfer learning. Experiments demonstrate that
improvement over finetuning based transfer learning is possible with
specialized supervised transfer learning methods.

                                        <span>  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel
view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the
substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective
compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the
point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for
compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the
unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual
information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context
(HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces
a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us
to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully
designed context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian
distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized
attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable
high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity
restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to
eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer
to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a
remarkable size reduction of over $75\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while
simultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\times$ size reduction
over SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS. Our code is available here:

                                        <span>  Precise manipulation that is generalizable across scenes and objects remains
a persistent challenge in robotics. Current approaches for this task heavily
depend on having a significant number of training instances to handle objects
with pronounced visual and/or geometric part ambiguities. Our work explores the
grounding of fine-grained part descriptors for precise manipulation in a
zero-shot setting by utilizing web-trained text-to-image diffusion-based
generative models. We tackle the problem by framing it as a dense semantic part
correspondence task. Our model returns a gripper pose for manipulating a
specific part, using as reference a user-defined click from a source image of a
visually different instance of the same object. We require no manual grasping
demonstrations as we leverage the intrinsic object geometry and features.
Practical experiments in a real-world tabletop scenario validate the efficacy
of our approach, demonstrating its potential for advancing semantic-aware
robotics manipulation. Web page: https://tsagkas.github.io/click2grasp

visibility of the needle can be severely impeded due to steep insertion and
strong distractors such as speckle noise and anatomical occlusion. To address
this challenge, we propose VibNet, a learning-based framework tailored to
enhance the robustness and accuracy of needle detection in ultrasound images,
even when the target becomes invisible to the naked eye. Inspired by Eulerian
Video Magnification techniques, we utilize an external step motor to induce
low-amplitude periodic motion on the needle. These subtle vibrations offer the
potential to generate robust frequency features for detecting the motion
patterns around the needle. To robustly and precisely detect the needle
leveraging these vibrations, VibNet integrates learning-based
Short-Time-Fourier-Transform and Hough-Transform modules to achieve successive
sub-goals, including motion feature extraction in the spatiotemporal space,
frequency feature aggregation, and needle detection in the Hough space. Based
on the results obtained on distinct ex vivo porcine and bovine tissue samples,
the proposed algorithm exhibits superior detection performance with efficient
computation and generalization capability.

in various fields has achieved remarkable success. However, as the foundation
model for many downstream tasks, current MLLMs are composed of the well-known
Transformer network, which has a less efficient quadratic computation
complexity. To improve the efficiency of such basic models, we propose Cobra, a
linear computational complexity MLLM. Specifically, Cobra integrates the
efficient Mamba language model into the visual modality. Moreover, we explore
and study various modal fusion schemes to create an effective multi-modal
Mamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) Cobra achieves extremely
competitive performance with current computationally efficient state-of-the-art
methods, \textit{e.g.}, LLaVA-Phi, TinyLLaVA, and MobileVLM v2, and has faster
speed due to Cobra's linear sequential modeling. (2) Interestingly, the results
of closed-set challenging prediction benchmarks show that Cobra performs well
in overcoming visual illusions and spatial relationship judgments. (3) Notably,
Cobra even achieves comparable performance to LLaVA with about 43% of the
number of parameters. We will make all codes of Cobra open-source and hope that
the proposed method can facilitate future research on complexity problems in
MLLM. Our project page is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/cobravlm.

in appearance-based identity association across homogeneous cameras, such as
ground-ground matching. However, as a more practical scenario, aerial-ground
person re-identification (AGPReID) among heterogeneous cameras has received
minimal attention. To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identity
representation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challenge
in AGPReID, the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yet
effective framework. Two major components are designed in VDT to decouple
view-related and view-unrelated features, namely hierarchical subtractive
separation and orthogonal loss, where the former separates these two features
inside the VDT, and the latter constrains these two to be independent. In
addition, we contribute a large-scale AGPReID dataset called CARGO, consisting
of five/eight aerial/ground cameras, 5,000 identities, and 108,563 images.
Experiments on two datasets show that VDT is a feasible and effective solution
for AGPReID, surpassing the previous method on mAP/Rank1 by up to 5.0%/2.7% on
CARGO and 3.7%/5.2% on AG-ReID, keeping the same magnitude of computational
complexity. Our project is available at https://github.com/LinlyAC/VDT-AGPReID

automated analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images, e.g., for the evaluation
of volumetric changes. However, many of the evaluation tools are optimized for
analyzing healthy tissue. To enable the evaluation of scans containing
pathological tissue, it is therefore required to restore healthy tissue in the
pathological areas. In this work, we explore and extend denoising diffusion
models for consistent inpainting of healthy 3D brain tissue. We modify
state-of-the-art 2D, pseudo-3D, and 3D methods working in the image space, as
well as 3D latent and 3D wavelet diffusion models, and train them to synthesize
healthy brain tissue. Our evaluation shows that the pseudo-3D model performs
best regarding the structural-similarity index, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and
mean squared error. To emphasize the clinical relevance, we fine-tune this
model on data containing synthetic MS lesions and evaluate it on a downstream
brain tissue segmentation task, whereby it outperforms the established FMRIB
Software Library (FSL) lesion-filling method.

                                        <span>  We propose a novel approach to video anomaly detection: we treat feature
vectors extracted from videos as realizations of a random variable with a fixed
distribution and model this distribution with a neural network. This lets us
estimate the likelihood of test videos and detect video anomalies by
thresholding the likelihood estimates. We train our video anomaly detector
using a modification of denoising score matching, a method that injects
training data with noise to facilitate modeling its distribution. To eliminate
hyperparameter selection, we model the distribution of noisy video features
across a range of noise levels and introduce a regularizer that tends to align
the models for different levels of noise. At test time, we combine anomaly
indications at multiple noise scales with a Gaussian mixture model. Running our
video anomaly detector induces minimal delays as inference requires merely
extracting the features and forward-propagating them through a shallow neural
network and a Gaussian mixture model. Our experiments on five popular video
anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, both in
the object-centric and in the frame-centric setup.

                                        <span>  Traditional knowledge distillation (KD) relies on a proficient teacher
trained on the target task, which is not always available. In this setting,
cross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model
trained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when
applied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a
simple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this
drop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to
disregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's
performance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending
many KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks
can be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the
cross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional
cost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%)
when using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depth
estimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack of
any learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analytical
insights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the
distillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral
regularisation component. Through this analysis we are additionally able to
propose a novel regularisation loss that allows teacher-free distillation,
enabling performance improvements of up to 8.57% on ImageNet with no additional
training costs.

is crucial, especially in critical domains like healthcare where significant
financial interests heighten the risk of such attacks. Whole slide images
(WSIs) are high-resolution, digitized versions of tissue samples mounted on
glass slides, scanned using sophisticated imaging equipment. The digital
analysis of WSIs presents unique challenges due to their gigapixel size and
multi-resolution storage format. In this work, we aim at improving the
robustness of cancer Gleason grading classification systems against adversarial
attacks, addressing challenges at both the image and graph levels. As regards
the proposed algorithm, we develop a novel and innovative graph-based model
which utilizes GNN to extract features from the graph representation of WSIs. A
denoising module, along with a pooling layer is incorporated to manage the
impact of adversarial attacks on the WSIs. The process concludes with a
transformer module that classifies various grades of prostate cancer based on
the processed data. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
conducted a comparative analysis using two scenarios. Initially, we trained and
tested the model without the denoiser using WSIs that had not been exposed to
any attack. We then introduced a range of attacks at either the image or graph
level and processed them through the proposed network. The performance of the
model was evaluated in terms of accuracy and kappa scores. The results from
this comparison showed a significant improvement in cancer diagnosis accuracy,
highlighting the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling
adversarial challenges in the context of medical imaging.

                                        <span>  Recently, how to achieve precise image editing has attracted increasing
attention, especially given the remarkable success of text-to-image generation
models. To unify various spatial-aware image editing abilities into one
framework, we adopt the concept of layers from the design domain to manipulate
objects flexibly with various operations. The key insight is to transform the
spatial-aware image editing task into a combination of two sub-tasks:
multi-layered latent decomposition and multi-layered latent fusion. First, we
segment the latent representations of the source images into multiple layers,
which include several object layers and one incomplete background layer that
necessitates reliable inpainting. To avoid extra tuning, we further explore the
inner inpainting ability within the self-attention mechanism. We introduce a
key-masking self-attention scheme that can propagate the surrounding context
information into the masked region while mitigating its impact on the regions
outside the mask. Second, we propose an instruction-guided latent fusion that
pastes the multi-layered latent representations onto a canvas latent. We also
introduce an artifact suppression scheme in the latent space to enhance the
inpainting quality. Due to the inherent modular advantages of such
multi-layered representations, we can achieve accurate image editing, and we
demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses the latest spatial editing
methods, including Self-Guidance and DiffEditor. Last, we show that our
approach is a unified framework that supports various accurate image editing
tasks on more than six different editing tasks.

characterized by varied social cognitive challenges and repetitive behavioral
patterns. Identifying reliable brain imaging-based biomarkers for ASD has been
a persistent challenge due to the spectrum's diverse symptomatology. Existing
baselines in the field have made significant strides in this direction, yet
there remains room for improvement in both performance and interpretability. We
propose \emph{HyperGALE}, which builds upon the hypergraph by incorporating
learned hyperedges and gated attention mechanisms. This approach has led to
substantial improvements in the model's ability to interpret complex brain
graph data, offering deeper insights into ASD biomarker characterization.
Evaluated on the extensive ABIDE II dataset, \emph{HyperGALE} not only improves
interpretability but also demonstrates statistically significant enhancements
in key performance metrics compared to both previous baselines and the
foundational hypergraph model. The advancement \emph{HyperGALE} brings to ASD

has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general
performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed
Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the
toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further
provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxify
approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely
suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity
of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We
hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing
detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code

                                        <span>  Video-to-video editing involves editing a source video along with additional
control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video
that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods
have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet
the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel
training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary
steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.
InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an
existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion
and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing
image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.
Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support
novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,
subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by
previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing
image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature
injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source
video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the
previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human
preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high
success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to
seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such
compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse
user demands.

                                        <span>  In minimally invasive endovascular procedures, contrast-enhanced angiography
remains the most robust imaging technique. However, it is at the expense of the
patient and clinician's health due to prolonged radiation exposure. As an
alternative, interventional ultrasound has notable benefits such as being
radiation-free, fast to deploy, and having a small footprint in the operating
room. Yet, ultrasound is hard to interpret, and highly prone to artifacts and
noise. Additionally, interventional radiologists must undergo extensive
training before they become qualified to diagnose and treat patients
effectively, leading to a shortage of staff, and a lack of open-source
datasets. In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a
self-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal
ultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data. The network architecture
builds upon AiAReSeg, a segmentation transformer built with the Attention in
Attention mechanism, and is capable of learning feature changes across time and
space. To facilitate training, we used synthetic ultrasound data based on
physics-driven catheter insertion simulations, and translated the data into a
unique CT-Ultrasound common domain, CACTUSS, to improve the segmentation
performance. We generated ground truth segmentation masks by computing the
optical flow between adjacent frames using FlowNet2, and performed thresholding
to obtain a binary map estimate. Finally, we validated our model on a test
dataset, consisting of unseen synthetic data and images collected from silicon
aorta phantoms, thus demonstrating its potential for applications to clinical
data in the future.

in dyadic interactions between users and \spot, the quadruped robot
manufactured by Boston Dynamics. The key-novelty is the focus on the robot's
perspective, i.e., on the data captured by the robot's sensors. These make 3D
body pose analysis challenging because being close to the ground captures
humans only partially. The scenario underlying HARPER includes 15 actions, of
which 10 involve physical contact between the robot and users. The Corpus
contains not only the recordings of the built-in stereo cameras of Spot, but
also those of a 6-camera OptiTrack system (all recordings are synchronized).
This leads to ground-truth skeletal representations with a precision lower than
a millimeter. In addition, the Corpus includes reproducible benchmarks on 3D
Human Pose Estimation, Human Pose Forecasting, and Collision Prediction, all
based on publicly available baseline approaches. This enables future HARPER
users to rigorously compare their results with those we provide in this work.

applications, conducting comprehensive robustness testing is essential.
However, the robustness of DLA models remains underexplored in the literature.
To address this, we are the first to introduce a robustness benchmark for DLA
models, which includes 450K document images of three datasets. To cover
realistic corruptions, we propose a perturbation taxonomy with 36 common
document perturbations inspired by real-world document processing.
Additionally, to better understand document perturbation impacts, we propose
two metrics, Mean Perturbation Effect (mPE) for perturbation assessment and
Mean Robustness Degradation (mRD) for robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we
introduce a self-titled model, i.e., Robust Document Layout Analyzer (RoDLA),
which improves attention mechanisms to boost extraction of robust features.
Experiments on the proposed benchmarks (PubLayNet-P, DocLayNet-P, and
M$^6$Doc-P) demonstrate that RoDLA obtains state-of-the-art mRD scores of
115.7, 135.4, and 150.4, respectively. Compared to previous methods, RoDLA
achieves notable improvements in mAP of +3.8%, +7.1% and +12.1%, respectively.

to their ability to offer probabilistic modeling and generate diverse outputs.
This versatility inspired their adaptation for image segmentation, where
multiple predictions of the model can produce segmentation results that not
only achieve high quality but also capture the uncertainty inherent in the
model. Here, powerful architectures were proposed for improving diffusion
segmentation performance. However, there is a notable lack of analysis and
discussions on the differences between diffusion segmentation and image
generation, and thorough evaluations are missing that distinguish the
improvements these architectures provide for segmentation in general from their
benefit for diffusion segmentation specifically. In this work, we critically
analyse and discuss how diffusion segmentation for medical images differs from
diffusion image generation, with a particular focus on the training behavior.
Furthermore, we conduct an assessment how proposed diffusion segmentation
architectures perform when trained directly for segmentation. Lastly, we
explore how different medical segmentation tasks influence the diffusion
segmentation behavior and the diffusion process could be adapted accordingly.
With these analyses, we aim to provide in-depth insights into the behavior of
diffusion segmentation that allow for a better design and evaluation of
diffusion segmentation methods in the future.

the conversion to RGB, lowering computation time significantly. Two CNN
classifiers are used to classify the images in both formats, confirming that
classification performance can indeed be preserved. We furthermore show that
the total computation time from RAW image data to classification results for
RAW images can be up to 8.46 times faster than RGB. These results contribute to
the evidence found in related works, that using RAW images as direct input to
computer vision algorithms looks very promising.

                                        <span>  To visualize the regions of interest that classifiers base their decisions
on, different Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods have been developed.
However, all of these techniques target categorical classifiers only, though
most real-world tasks are binary classification. In this paper, we extend
gradient-based CAM techniques to work with binary classifiers and visualize the
active regions for binary facial attribute classifiers. When training an
unbalanced binary classifier on an imbalanced dataset, it is well-known that
the majority class, i.e. the class with many training samples, is mostly
predicted much better than minority class with few training instances. In our
experiments on the CelebA dataset, we verify these results, when training an
unbalanced classifier to extract 40 facial attributes simultaneously. One would
expect that the biased classifier has learned to extract features mainly for
the majority classes and that the proportional energy of the activations mainly
reside in certain specific regions of the image where the attribute is located.
However, we find very little regular activation for samples of majority
classes, while the active regions for minority classes seem mostly reasonable
and overlap with our expectations. These results suggest that biased
classifiers mainly rely on bias activation for majority classes. When training
a balanced classifier on the imbalanced data by employing attribute-specific
class weights, majority and minority classes are classified similarly well and
show expected activations for almost all attributes

                                        <span>  This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find
the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related
question. This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a
question may have multiple answers. However, due to annotation costs, the
labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one
answer per question. As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the
unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for
generalization. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking
distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional
manual annotation. RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels
to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about
label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the
insufficient labeling information. To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect
teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking
distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft
margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise
rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise
learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking. Extensive experiments on five
popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs
outperform state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis demonstrates the
effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem.

diffusion models, notably improving the quality of generated images. Despite
these developments, generating images with unseen characteristics beneficial
for downstream tasks has received limited attention. To bridge this gap, we
propose Style-Extracting Diffusion Models, featuring two conditioning
mechanisms. Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which
allows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image
generation and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream
task, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to
extract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges
style information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the
generation of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging
styles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work,
we use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of
our method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further
demonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge
about tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic
images with known layouts. This allows us to generate additional synthetic data
to train a segmentation network in a semi-supervised fashion. We verify the
added value of the generated images by showing improved segmentation results
and lower performance variability between patients when synthetic images are
included during segmentation training. Our code will be made publicly available
at [LINK].

memorization, possibly reproducing near-perfect replica of images that they are
trained on, which may be undesirable. To remedy this issue, we develop the
first differentially private (DP) retrieval-augmented generation algorithm that
is capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable
privacy guarantees. Specifically, we assume access to a text-to-image diffusion
model trained on a small amount of public data, and design a DP retrieval
mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private
retrieval dataset. Our \emph{differentially private retrieval-augmented
diffusion model} (DP-RDM) requires no fine-tuning on the retrieval dataset to
adapt to another domain, and can use state-of-the-art generative models to
generate high-quality image samples while satisfying rigorous DP guarantees.
For instance, when evaluated on MS-COCO, our DP-RDM can generate samples with a
privacy budget of $\epsilon=10$, while providing a $3.5$ point improvement in
FID compared to public-only retrieval for up to $10,000$ queries.

point cloud transformers. They quickly overwhelmed sparse CNNs and became
state-of-the-art models, especially in 3D semantic segmentation. However,
sparse CNNs are still valuable networks, due to their efficiency treasure, and
ease of application. In this work, we reexamine the design distinctions and
test the limits of what a sparse CNN can achieve. We discover that the key
credit to the performance difference is adaptivity. Specifically, we propose
two key components, i.e., adaptive receptive fields (spatially) and adaptive
relation, to bridge the gap. This exploration led to the creation of
Omni-Adaptive 3D CNNs (OA-CNNs), a family of networks that integrates a
lightweight module to greatly enhance the adaptivity of sparse CNNs at minimal
computational cost. Without any self-attention modules, OA-CNNs favorably
surpass point transformers in terms of accuracy in both indoor and outdoor
scenes, with much less latency and memory cost. Notably, it achieves 76.1%,
78.9%, and 70.6% mIoU on ScanNet v2, nuScenes, and SemanticKITTI validation
benchmarks respectively, while maintaining at most 5x better speed than
transformer counterparts. This revelation highlights the potential of pure
sparse CNNs to outperform transformer-related networks.

synthesis when a sufficiently large amount of views are available. When dealing
with few-shot settings, i.e. with a small set of input views, the training
could overfit those views, leading to artifacts and geometric and chromatic
inconsistencies in the resulting rendering. Regularization is a valid solution
that helps NeRF generalization. On the other hand, each of the most recent NeRF
regularization techniques aim to mitigate a specific rendering problem.
Starting from this observation, in this paper we propose CombiNeRF, a framework
that synergically combines several regularization techniques, some of them
novel, in order to unify the benefits of each. In particular, we regularize
single and neighboring rays distributions and we add a smoothness term to
regularize near geometries. After these geometric approaches, we propose to
exploit Lipschitz regularization to both NeRF density and color networks and to
use encoding masks for input features regularization. We show that CombiNeRF
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with few-shot settings in several
publicly available datasets. We also present an ablation study on the LLFF and
NeRF-Synthetic datasets that support the choices made. We release with this
paper the open-source implementation of our framework.

                                        <span>  Deep neural networks often exhibit sub-optimal performance under covariate
and category shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) presents a promising
solution to this dilemma, yet most SFDA approaches are restricted to closed-set
scenarios. In this paper, we explore Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation
(SF-UniDA) aiming to accurately classify "known" data belonging to common
categories and segregate them from target-private "unknown" data. We propose a
novel Global and Local Clustering (GLC) technique, which comprises an adaptive
one-vs-all global clustering algorithm to discern between target classes,
complemented by a local k-NN clustering strategy to mitigate negative transfer.
Despite the effectiveness, the inherent closed-set source architecture leads to
uniform treatment of "unknown" data, impeding the identification of distinct
"unknown" categories. To address this, we evolve GLC to GLC++, integrating a
contrastive affinity learning strategy. We examine the superiority of GLC and
GLC++ across multiple benchmarks and category shift scenarios. Remarkably, in
the most challenging open-partial-set scenarios, GLC and GLC++ surpass GATE by
16.7% and 18.6% in H-score on VisDA, respectively. GLC++ enhances the novel
category clustering accuracy of GLC by 4.3% in open-set scenarios on
Office-Home. Furthermore, the introduced contrastive learning strategy not only
enhances GLC but also significantly facilitates existing methodologies.

                                        <span>  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable success
across various vision-language tasks. However, they suffer from visual
hallucination, where the generated responses diverge from the provided image.
Are MLLMs completely oblivious to accurate visual cues when they hallucinate?
Our investigation reveals that the visual branch may simultaneously advocate
both accurate and non-existent content. To address this issue, we propose
Pensieve, a training-free method inspired by our observation that analogous
visual hallucinations can arise among images sharing common semantic and
appearance characteristics. During inference, Pensieve enables MLLMs to
retrospect relevant images as references and compare them with the test image.
This paradigm assists MLLMs in downgrading hallucinatory content mistakenly
supported by the visual input. Experiments on Whoops, MME, POPE, and LLaVA
Bench demonstrate the efficacy of Pensieve in mitigating visual hallucination,
surpassing other advanced decoding strategies. Additionally, Pensieve aids
MLLMs in identifying details in the image and enhancing the specificity of
image descriptions.

(FSCIL), which is a challenging form of continual learning that involves
continuous adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. FSCIL requires both
stability and adaptability, i.e., preserving proficiency in previously learned
tasks while learning new ones. Our proposed bag of tricks brings together eight
key and highly influential techniques that improve stability, adaptability, and
overall performance under a unified framework for FSCIL. We organize these
tricks into three categories: stability tricks, adaptability tricks, and
training tricks. Stability tricks aim to mitigate the forgetting of previously
learned classes by enhancing the separation between the embeddings of learned
classes and minimizing interference when learning new ones. On the other hand,
adaptability tricks focus on the effective learning of new classes. Finally,
training tricks improve the overall performance without compromising stability
or adaptability. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets,
CIFAR-100, CUB-200, and miniIMageNet, to evaluate the impact of our proposed
framework. Our detailed analysis shows that our approach substantially improves
both stability and adaptability, establishing a new state-of-the-art by
outperforming prior works in the area. We believe our method provides a go-to
solution and establishes a robust baseline for future research in this area.

                                        <span>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent one of the most widely used
neural network architectures, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in
computer vision tasks. Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy,
their size can be effectively reduced by "tensorization" while maintaining
accuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with
compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or
quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly
training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards
low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the
accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution
kernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we
truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50
pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We
found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be
truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but
not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation
compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how
information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated
models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs
of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of
convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our
results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.

applications such as Google Earth and many game engines, exhibits the
capability to holistically represent a large scene even the Earth, and achieves
rendering with a space complexity of O(log n). This constrained data
requirement not only enhances rendering efficiency but also facilitates dynamic
data fetching, thereby enabling a seamless 3D navigation experience for users.
In this work, we extend this proven LoD technique to Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) by introducing an octree structure to represent the scenes in different
scales. This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant
representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the
efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training
strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n). This strategy allows for parallel
training with minimal overhead, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of our
proposed method. Our contribution is not only in extending the capabilities of
existing techniques but also in establishing a foundation for scalable and
efficient large-scale scene representation using NeRF and octree structures.

                                        <span>  In this work we propose a novel method for unsupervised controllable video
generation. Once trained on a dataset of unannotated videos, at inference our
model is capable of both composing scenes of predefined object parts and
animating them in a plausible and controlled way. This is achieved by
conditioning video generation on a randomly selected subset of local
pre-trained self-supervised features during training. We call our model CAGE
for visual Composition and Animation for video GEneration. We conduct a series
of experiments to demonstrate capabilities of CAGE in various settings. Project

                                        <span>  Vision-centric 3D environment understanding is both vital and challenging for
autonomous driving systems. Recently, object-free methods have attracted
considerable attention. Such methods perceive the world by predicting the
semantics of discrete voxel grids but fail to construct continuous and accurate
obstacle surfaces. To this end, in this paper, we propose SurroundSDF to
implicitly predict the signed distance field (SDF) and semantic field for the
continuous perception from surround images. Specifically, we introduce a
query-based approach and utilize SDF constrained by the Eikonal formulation to
accurately describe the surfaces of obstacles. Furthermore, considering the
absence of precise SDF ground truth, we propose a novel weakly supervised
paradigm for SDF, referred to as the Sandwich Eikonal formulation, which
emphasizes applying correct and dense constraints on both sides of the surface,
thereby enhancing the perceptual accuracy of the surface. Experiments suggest
that our method achieves SOTA for both occupancy prediction and 3D scene
reconstruction tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

                                        <span>  Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) focuses on recognizing seen and unseen
classes against domain shift problem (DSP) where data of unseen classes may be
misclassified as seen classes. However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen
domains. In the current work, we pioneer cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which
addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods
which alleviate DSP by generating features of unseen classes with semantics,
CDGZSL needs to construct a common feature space across domains and acquire the
corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to
unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by
redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we
present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR
consists of two parts: Inter-class Similarity Alignment (ISA), which eliminates
the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of
inter-class feature relationships, and Unseen-class Meta Generation (UMG),
which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and
unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the
redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the
information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on
the Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics
for these datasets as the benchmark.

These images have the advantage of higher spectral resolution. Advanced
spectral processing techniques are required to unlock the information potential
in these HS images. The present paper introduces a method rooted in
multivariate statistics designed to detect parasitic Varroa destructor mites on
the body of western honey bee Apis mellifera, enabling easier and continuous
monitoring of the bee hives. The methodology explores unsupervised (K-means++)
and recently developed supervised (Kernel Flows - Partial Least-Squares,
KF-PLS) methods for parasitic identification. Additionally, in light of the
emergence of custom-band multispectral cameras, the present research outlines a
strategy for identifying the specific wavelengths necessary for effective
bee-mite separation, suitable for implementation in a custom-band camera.
Illustrated with a real-case dataset, our findings demonstrate that as few as
four spectral bands are sufficient for accurate parasite identification.

no-visual-clue of lanes due to factors such as lighting conditions and
occlusion remain challenging and crucial for automated driving. Moreover,
current lane representations require complex post-processing and struggle with
specific instances. Inspired by the DETR architecture, we propose LDTR, a
transformer-based model to address these issues. Lanes are modeled with a novel
anchor-chain, regarding a lane as a whole from the beginning, which enables
LDTR to handle special lanes inherently. To enhance lane instance perception,
LDTR incorporates a novel multi-referenced deformable attention module to
distribute attention around the object. Additionally, LDTR incorporates two
line IoU algorithms to improve convergence efficiency and employs a Gaussian
heatmap auxiliary branch to enhance model representation capability during
training. To evaluate lane detection models, we rely on Frechet distance,
parameterized F1-score, and additional synthetic metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that LDTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-known
datasets.

tasks when provided with sufficient pixel-wise labeled data. However, the high
cost of manual annotation has created a bottleneck for model generalization. To
minimize annotation costs, we propose a deep active learning framework for
annotation-efficient polyp segmentation. In practice, we measure the
uncertainty of each sample by examining the similarity between features masked
by the prediction map of the polyp and the background area. Since the
segmentation model tends to perform weak in samples with indistinguishable
features of foreground and background areas, uncertainty sampling facilitates
the fitting of under-learning data. Furthermore, clustering image-level
features weighted by uncertainty identify samples that are both uncertain and
representative. To enhance the selectivity of the active selection strategy, we
propose a novel unsupervised feature discrepancy learning mechanism. The
selection strategy and feature optimization work in tandem to achieve optimal
performance with a limited annotation budget. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated that our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art
performance compared to other competitors on both a public dataset and a
large-scale in-house dataset.

significant attention due to their remarkable interpretability achieved by the
interpretable concept bottleneck. However, despite the transparency of the
concept-to-label prediction, the mapping from the input to the intermediate
concept remains a black box, giving rise to concerns about the trustworthiness
of the learned concepts (i.e., these concepts may be predicted based on
spurious cues). The issue of concept untrustworthiness greatly hampers the
interpretability of CBMs, thereby hindering their further advancement. To
conduct a comprehensive analysis on this issue, in this study we establish a
benchmark to assess the trustworthiness of concepts in CBMs. A pioneering
metric, referred to as concept trustworthiness score, is proposed to gauge
whether the concepts are derived from relevant regions. Additionally, an
enhanced CBM is introduced, enabling concept predictions to be made
specifically from distinct parts of the feature map, thereby facilitating the
exploration of their related regions. Besides, we introduce three modules,
namely the cross-layer alignment (CLA) module, the cross-image alignment (CIA)
module, and the prediction alignment (PA) module, to further enhance the
concept trustworthiness within the elaborated CBM. The experiments on five
datasets across ten architectures demonstrate that without using any concept
localization annotations during training, our model improves the concept
trustworthiness by a large margin, meanwhile achieving superior accuracy to the
state-of-the-arts. Our code is available at https://github.com/hqhQAQ/ProtoCBM.

Learning (multi-mag MIL) has proven effective in leveraging the hierarchical
structure of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to reduce information loss and redundant
data. However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between
pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial
relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we
introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which
innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point
concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to
effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and
providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL
distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to
superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional
performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1
scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically,
CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\%
respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional
MIL approaches.

                                        <span>  Machine Unlearning, the process of selectively eliminating the influence of
certain data examples used during a model's training, has gained significant
attention as a means for practitioners to comply with recent data protection
regulations. However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks,
including their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number
of hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data
portions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more
effective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and
Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\nabla \tau$), an optimization framework
designed to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It
applies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using
standard gradient descent for the remaining data. $\nabla \tau$ offers multiple
benefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections
of the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various
unlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable
across different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $\nabla \tau$
requires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than
retraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness
using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics,
demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.

model's performance on unseen domains. Existing methods either rely on domain
labels to align domain-invariant feature spaces, or disentangle generalizable
features from the whole sample, which inevitably lead to the distortion of
semantic feature structures and achieve limited generalization. In this work,
we make use of large-scale VLMs like CLIP and leverage the textual feature to
dynamically adjust the classifier's weights for exploring generalizable visual
features. Specifically, we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL)
paradigm for DG FAS, which utilizes two lightweight transformers, namely
Content Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF), to learn the different
semantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of
learnable query vectors, respectively. Thus, the generalizable prompt can be
learned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is
introduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative
of the content description. (2) A Diversified Style Prompt (DSP) technology is
proposed to diversify the learning of style prompts by mixing feature
statistics between instance-specific styles. Finally, the learned text features
modulate visual features to generalization through the designed Prompt
Modulation (PM). Extensive experiments show that the CFPL is effective and
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several cross-domain datasets.

                                        <span>  The integration of deep learning techniques with biophotonic setups has
opened new horizons in bioimaging. A compelling trend in this field involves
deliberately compromising certain measurement metrics to engineer better
bioimaging tools in terms of cost, speed, and form-factor, followed by
compensating for the resulting defects through the utilization of deep learning
models trained on a large amount of ideal, superior or alternative data. This
strategic approach has found increasing popularity due to its potential to
enhance various aspects of biophotonic imaging. One of the primary motivations
for employing this strategy is the pursuit of higher temporal resolution or
increased imaging speed, critical for capturing fine dynamic biological
processes. This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware
requirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more
accessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth
review of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair
in their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function,
signal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution. By deliberately
compromising these metrics, researchers aim to not only recuperate them through
the application of deep learning networks, but also bolster in return other
crucial parameters, such as the field-of-view, depth-of-field, and
space-bandwidth product. Here, we discuss various biophotonic methods that have
successfully employed this strategic approach. These techniques span broad
applications and showcase the versatility and effectiveness of deep learning in
the context of compromised biophotonic data. Finally, by offering our
perspectives on the future possibilities of this rapidly evolving concept, we
hope to motivate our readers to explore novel ways of balancing hardware
compromises with compensation via AI.

developed. They will require accurate and robust scene understanding systems.
Current research has used vision to identify immediate terrain and geometric
obstacles, however these approaches are constrained to detections directly in
front of the user and are limited to classifying a finite range of terrain
types (e.g., stairs, ramps and level-ground). This paper presents Exosense, a
vision-centric scene understanding system which is capable of generating rich,
globally-consistent elevation maps, incorporating both semantic and terrain
traversability information. It features an elastic Atlas mapping framework
associated with a visual SLAM pose graph, embedded with open-vocabulary room
labels from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). The device's design includes a wide
field-of-view (FoV) fisheye multi-camera system to mitigate the challenges
introduced by the exoskeleton walking pattern. We demonstrate the system's
robustness to the challenges of typical periodic walking gaits, and its ability
to construct accurate semantically-rich maps in indoor settings. Additionally,
we showcase its potential for motion planning -- providing a step towards safe
navigation for exoskeletons.

effectiveness in facial expression recognition (FER). However, they face
challenges when dealing with high computational complexity and multi-view head
poses in real-world scenarios. We introduce a lightweight attentional network
incorporating multi-scale feature fusion (LANMSFF) to tackle these issues. For
the first challenge, we have carefully designed a lightweight fully
convolutional network (FCN). We address the second challenge by presenting two
novel components, namely mass attention (MassAtt) and point wise feature
selection (PWFS) blocks. The MassAtt block simultaneously generates channel and
spatial attention maps to recalibrate feature maps by emphasizing important
features while suppressing irrelevant ones. On the other hand, the PWFS block
employs a feature selection mechanism that discards less meaningful features
prior to the fusion process. This mechanism distinguishes it from previous
methods that directly fuse multi-scale features. Our proposed approach achieved
results comparable to state-of-the-art methods in terms of parameter counts and
robustness to pose variation, with accuracy rates of 90.77% on KDEF, 70.44% on
FER-2013, and 86.96% on FERPlus datasets. The code for LANMSFF is available at
https://github.com/AE-1129/LANMSFF.

(ANNs) has led to a growing interest in incorporating the self-attention
mechanism and transformer-based architecture into Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs). While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that
are compatible with SNNs, they lack reasonable scaling methods, and the overall
architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively
extracting local features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
spiking self-attention mechanism named Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA) with a
reasonable scaling method. Based on DSSA, we propose a novel spiking Vision
Transformer architecture called SpikingResformer, which combines the
ResNet-based multi-stage architecture with our proposed DSSA to improve both
performance and energy efficiency while reducing parameters. Experimental
results show that SpikingResformer achieves higher accuracy with fewer
parameters and lower energy consumption than other spiking Vision Transformer
counterparts. Notably, our SpikingResformer-L achieves 79.40% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet with 4 time-steps, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN
field.

sources are commonly approached with machine learning models. However, there is
a common assumption that data sources will be persistently available. Different
situations could affect the availability of EO sources, like noise, clouds, or
satellite mission failures. In this work, we assess the impact of missing
temporal and static EO sources in trained models across four datasets with
classification and regression tasks. We compare the predictive quality of
different methods and find that some are naturally more robust to missing data.
The Ensemble strategy, in particular, achieves a prediction robustness up to
100%. We evidence that missing scenarios are significantly more challenging in
regression than classification tasks. Finally, we find that the optical view is
the most critical view when it is missing individually.

approaches efficiency, for image inpainting, often requires extensive data

(HySim), which combines both strengths of Chebychev and Minkowski distances.
This hybridization enhances patch selection, leading to high-quality inpainting
results with reduced mismatch errors. Experimental results proved the

generating high-quality images from text prompts, models such as Stable
Diffusion have been successfully extended to the joint generation of semantic
segmentation pseudo-masks. However, current extensions primarily rely on
extracting attentions linked to prompt words used for image synthesis. This
approach limits the generation of segmentation masks derived from word tokens
not contained in the text prompt. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary
Attention Maps (OVAM)-a training-free method for text-to-image diffusion models
that enables the generation of attention maps for any word. In addition, we
propose a lightweight optimization process based on OVAM for finding tokens
that generate accurate attention maps for an object class with a single
annotation. We evaluate these tokens within existing state-of-the-art Stable
Diffusion extensions. The best-performing model improves its mIoU from 52.1 to
86.6 for the synthetic images' pseudo-masks, demonstrating that our optimized
tokens are an efficient way to improve the performance of existing methods
without architectural changes or retraining.

accompanied by a significant carbon footprint. This is mainly due to the use of
high-performance computing with accelerators and high training time. Studies
show that average deep NLP model produces around 626k lbs of

neural networks using the SSL embeddings extracted using the pre-trained model.
Our approach shows competitive results compared to the commonly used
high-carbon footprint approaches. In experiments with the ASVspoof 2019 LA
dataset, we achieve a 0.90\% equal error rate (EER) with less than 1k trainable
model parameters. To encourage further research in this direction and support
reproducible results, the Python code will be made publicly accessible

content-based retrieval methods often overlook significant non-semantic
information, limiting their effectiveness for flexible exploration across
varied themes. To broaden the applicability of image retrieval methods for
diverse purposes and uncover more general patterns, we innovatively introduce a
crucial factor from computational aesthetics, namely image composition, into
this topic. By explicitly integrating composition-related information extracted
by CNN into the designed retrieval model, our method considers both the image's
composition rules and semantic information. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that the image retrieval network guided by composition
information outperforms those relying solely on content information,
facilitating the identification of images in databases closer to the target
image in human perception. Please visit https://github.com/linty5/CCBIR to try

received as much focus as other components. Moreover, the robustness of speaker
diarization across various datasets hasn't been explored when the development
and evaluation data are from different domains. To bridge this gap, this study
thoroughly examines spectral clustering for both same-domain and cross-domain
speaker diarization. Our extensive experiments on two widely used corpora, AMI
and DIHARD, reveal the performance trend of speaker diarization in the presence
of domain mismatch. We observe that the performance difference between two
different domain conditions can be attributed to the role of spectral
clustering. In particular, keeping other modules unchanged, we show that
differences in optimal tuning parameters as well as speaker count estimation
originates due to the mismatch. This study opens several future directions for
speaker diarization research.

platforms interact with the environment. Yet, it presents many challenges,
often related to the lack of flexibility and generalizability of
state-of-the-art solutions. Diffusion models are a cutting-edge neural
architecture transforming 2D and 3D computer vision, outlining remarkable
performances in zero-shot novel-view synthesis. Such a use case is particularly
intriguing for reconstructing 3D objects. However, localizing objects in
unstructured environments is rather unexplored. To this end, this work presents
Zero123-6D to demonstrate the utility of Diffusion Model-based
novel-view-synthesizers in enhancing RGB 6D pose estimation at category-level
by integrating them with feature extraction techniques. The outlined method
exploits such a novel view synthesizer to expand a sparse set of RGB-only
reference views for the zero-shot 6D pose estimation task. Experiments are
quantitatively analyzed on the CO3D dataset, showcasing increased performance
over baselines, a substantial reduction in data requirements, and the removal
of the necessity of depth information.

relationships in images. Prior methods approach this task by adding separate
relationship modules or decoders to existing object detection architectures.
This separation increases complexity and hinders end-to-end training, which
limits performance. We propose a simple and highly efficient decoder-free
architecture for open-vocabulary visual relationship detection. Our model
consists of a Transformer-based image encoder that represents objects as tokens
and models their relationships implicitly. To extract relationship information,
we introduce an attention mechanism that selects object pairs likely to form a
relationship. We provide a single-stage recipe to train this model on a mixture
of object and relationship detection data. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art relationship detection performance on Visual Genome and on the
large-vocabulary GQA benchmark at real-time inference speeds. We provide
analyses of zero-shot performance, ablations, and real-world qualitative
examples.

                                        <span>  Portrait stylization is a challenging task involving the transformation of an
input portrait image into a specific style while preserving its inherent
characteristics. The recent introduction of Stable Diffusion (SD) has
significantly improved the quality of outcomes in this field. However, a
practical stylization framework that can effectively filter harmful input
content and preserve the distinct characteristics of an input, such as
skin-tone, while maintaining the quality of stylization remains lacking. These
challenges have hindered the wide deployment of such a framework. To address
these issues, this study proposes a portrait stylization framework that
incorporates a nudity content identification module (NCIM) and a
skin-tone-aware portrait stylization module (STAPSM). In experiments, NCIM
showed good performance in enhancing explicit content filtering, and STAPSM
accurately represented a diverse range of skin tones. Our proposed framework
has been successfully deployed in practice, and it has effectively satisfied
critical requirements of real-world applications.

However, they require comprehensive annotated data sets, which poses
challenges, particularly for rare diseases. Consequently, unsupervised anomaly
detection (UAD) emerges as a viable alternative for pathology segmentation, as
only healthy data is required for training. However, recent UAD anomaly scoring
functions often focus on intensity only and neglect structural differences,
which impedes the segmentation performance. This work investigates the
potential of Structural Similarity (SSIM) to bridge this gap. SSIM captures
both intensity and structural disparities and can be advantageous over the
classical $l1$ error. However, we show that there is more than one optimal
kernel size for the SSIM calculation for different pathologies. Therefore, we
investigate an adaptive ensembling strategy for various kernel sizes to offer a
more pathology-agnostic scoring mechanism. We demonstrate that this ensembling
strategy can enhance the performance of DMs and mitigate the sensitivity to
different kernel sizes across varying pathologies, highlighting its promise for
brain MRI anomaly detection.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes LayoutLLM, a more flexible document analysis method for
understanding imaged documents. Visually Rich Document Understanding tasks,
such as document image classification and information extraction, have gained
significant attention due to their importance. Existing methods have been
developed to enhance document comprehension by incorporating pre-training
awareness of images, text, and layout structure. However, these methods require
fine-tuning for each task and dataset, and the models are expensive to train
and operate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new LayoutLLM that
integrates these with large-scale language models (LLMs). By leveraging the
strengths of existing research in document image understanding and LLMs'
superior language understanding capabilities, the proposed model, fine-tuned
with multimodal instruction datasets, performs an understanding of document
images in a single model. Our experiments demonstrate improvement over the
baseline model in various document analysis tasks.

significantly propelled advancements in various research and clinical fields.
Nonetheless, concerns regarding unauthorized training of AI systems for
commercial purposes and the duties of patient privacy protection have led
numerous institutions to hesitate to share their images. This is particularly
true for medical image segmentation (MIS) datasets, where the processes of
collection and fine-grained annotation are time-intensive and laborious.
Recently, Unlearnable Examples (UEs) methods have shown the potential to
protect images by adding invisible shortcuts. These shortcuts can prevent
unauthorized deep neural networks from generalizing. However, existing UEs are
designed for natural image classification and fail to protect MIS datasets
imperceptibly as their protective perturbations are less learnable than
important prior knowledge in MIS, e.g., contour and texture features. To this
end, we propose an Unlearnable Medical image generation method, termed UMed.
UMed integrates the prior knowledge of MIS by injecting contour- and
texture-aware perturbations to protect images. Given that our target is to only
poison features critical to MIS, UMed requires only minimal perturbations
within the ROI and its contour to achieve greater imperceptibility (average
PSNR is 50.03) and protective performance (clean average DSC degrades from
82.18% to 6.80%).

                                        <span>  The 3D Gaussian splatting method has drawn a lot of attention, thanks to its
high performance in training and high quality of the rendered image. However,
it uses anisotropic Gaussian kernels to represent the scene. Although such
anisotropic kernels have advantages in representing the geometry, they lead to
difficulties in terms of computation, such as splitting or merging two kernels.
In this paper, we propose to use isotropic Gaussian kernels to avoid such
difficulties in the computation, leading to a higher performance method. The
experiments confirm that the proposed method is about {\bf 100X} faster without
losing the geometry representation accuracy. The proposed method can be applied
in a large range applications where the radiance field is needed, such as 3D
reconstruction, view synthesis, and dynamic object modeling.

medical discovery, diagnostics and patient management. However, the vast
complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines
machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately,
large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an
Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the
diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of
dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this
domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models
and sophisticated machine learning tools. This holistic approach achieves a
nuanced interpretation of dermatological conditions that simulates and
facilitates a dermatologist's workflow. We assess our proposed methodology
through a thorough cross-model validation technique embedded in an evaluation
pipeline that utilizes publicly available medical case studies of skin
conditions and relevant images. To quantitatively score the system performance,
advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools are employed
which focus on similarity comparison and natural language inference.
Additionally, we incorporate a human expert evaluation process based on a
structured checklist to further validate our results. We implemented the
proposed methodology in a system which achieved approximate (weighted) scores
of 0.87 for both contextual understanding and diagnostic accuracy,
demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing dermatological
analysis. The proposed methodology is expected to prove useful in the
development of next-generation tele-dermatology applications, enhancing remote
consultation capabilities and access to care, especially in underserved areas.

time-consuming frame-by-frame observation during annotation. Meanwhile,
video-level spotting lacks sufficient information about the location and number
of expressions during training, resulting in significantly inferior performance
compared with fully-supervised spotting. To bridge this gap, we propose a
point-level weakly-supervised expression spotting (PWES) framework, where each
expression requires to be annotated with only one random frame (i.e., a point).
To mitigate the issue of sparse label distribution, the prevailing solution is
pseudo-label mining, which, however, introduces new problems: localizing
contextual background snippets results in inaccurate boundaries and discarding
foreground snippets leads to fragmentary predictions. Therefore, we design the
strategies of multi-refined pseudo label generation (MPLG) and
distribution-guided feature contrastive learning (DFCL) to address these
problems. Specifically, MPLG generates more reliable pseudo labels by merging
class-specific probabilities, attention scores, fused features, and point-level
labels. DFCL is utilized to enhance feature similarity for the same categories
and feature variability for different categories while capturing global
representations across the entire datasets. Extensive experiments on the
CAS(ME)^2, CAS(ME)^3, and SAMM-LV datasets demonstrate PWES achieves promising
performance comparable to that of recent fully-supervised methods.

evaluated on approximately 5,000 visually inspected radio galaxies and their
infrared hosts, encompassing both compact and extended radio morphologies. We
find that the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the predicted and ground truth
bounding boxes is larger than 0.5 for 99% of the radio sources, and 98% of
predicted host positions are within $3^{\prime \prime}$ of the ground truth
infrared host in the evaluation set. The catalogue construction pipeline uses
the predictions of the trained network on the radio and infrared image cutouts
based on the catalogue of radio components identified using the Selavy source
finder algorithm. Confidence scores of the predictions are then used to
prioritize Selavy components with higher scores and incorporate them first into
the catalogue. This results in identifications for a total of 211,625 radio
sources, with 201,211 classified as compact and unresolved. The remaining
10,414 are categorized as extended radio morphologies, including 582 FR-I,
5,602 FR-II, 1,494 FR-x (uncertain whether FR-I or FR-II), 2,375 R (single-peak
resolved) radio galaxies, and 361 with peculiar and other rare morphologies. We
cross-match the radio sources in the catalogue with the infrared and optical
catalogues, finding infrared cross-matches for 73% and photometric redshifts
for 36% of the radio galaxies.

                                        <span>  Although mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) algorithms perform
well in academic datasets, their performance is limited in practical
application due to the ideal experimental setting of clean training data.
Training with noisy data is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly
detection but is seldom discussed. This paper considers label-level noise in
image sensory anomaly detection for the first time. To solve this problem, we
proposed a memory-based unsupervised AD method, SoftPatch, which efficiently
denoises the data at the patch level. Noise discriminators are utilized to
generate outlier scores for patch-level noise elimination before coreset
construction. The scores are then stored in the memory bank to soften the
anomaly detection boundary. Compared with existing methods, SoftPatch maintains
a strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviates the overconfidence
problem in coreset. Comprehensive experiments in various noise scenes
demonstrate that SoftPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art AD methods on the
MVTecAD and BTAD benchmarks and is comparable to those methods under the
setting without noise.

                                        <span>  In the context of high usability in single-class anomaly detection models,
recent academic research has become concerned about the more complex
multi-class anomaly detection. Although several papers have designed unified
models for this task, they often overlook the utility of class labels, a potent
tool for mitigating inter-class interference. To address this issue, we
introduce a Multi-class Implicit Neural representation Transformer for unified
Anomaly Detection (MINT-AD), which leverages the fine-grained category
information in the training stage. By learning the multi-class distributions,
the model generates class-aware query embeddings for the transformer decoder,
mitigating inter-class interference within the reconstruction model. Utilizing
such an implicit neural representation network, MINT-AD can project category
and position information into a feature embedding space, further supervised by
classification and prior probability loss functions. Experimental results on
multiple datasets demonstrate that MINT-AD outperforms existing unified
training models.

                                        <span>  Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify, at the pixel level, the
object in a visual scene that produces a given sound. Current AVS methods rely
on costly fine-grained annotations of mask-audio pairs, making them impractical
for scalability. To address this, we introduce unsupervised AVS, eliminating
the need for such expensive annotation. To tackle this more challenging
problem, we propose an unsupervised learning method, named Modality
Correspondence Alignment (MoCA), which seamlessly integrates off-the-shelf
foundation models like DINO, SAM, and ImageBind. This approach leverages their
knowledge complementarity and optimizes their joint usage for multi-modality
association. Initially, we estimate positive and negative image pairs in the
feature space. For pixel-level association, we introduce an audio-visual
adapter and a novel pixel matching aggregation strategy within the image-level
contrastive learning framework. This allows for a flexible connection between
object appearance and audio signal at the pixel level, with tolerance to
imaging variations such as translation and rotation. Extensive experiments on
the AVSBench (single and multi-object splits) and AVSS datasets demonstrate
that our MoCA outperforms strongly designed baseline methods and approaches
supervised counterparts, particularly in complex scenarios with multiple
auditory objects. Notably when comparing mIoU, MoCA achieves a substantial
improvement over baselines in both the AVSBench (S4: +17.24%; MS3: +67.64%) and
AVSS (+19.23%) audio-visual segmentation challenges.

biases that can lead to unfair models, emerges. Several debiasing approaches
have been proposed in the realm of deep learning, employing more or less
sophisticated approaches to discourage these models from massively employing
these biases. However, a question emerges: is this extra complexity really
necessary? Is a vanilla-trained model already embodying some ``unbiased
sub-networks'' that can be used in isolation and propose a solution without
relying on the algorithmic biases? In this work, we show that such a
sub-network typically exists, and can be extracted from a vanilla-trained model
without requiring additional training. We further validate that such specific
architecture is incapable of learning a specific bias, suggesting that there
are possible architectural countermeasures to the problem of biases in deep
neural networks.

large-area cross-view geo-localization (CVGL), encompassing both unsupervised
and semi-supervised settings. Common approaches to CVGL rely on
ground-satellite image pairs and employ label-driven supervised training.
However, the cost of collecting precise cross-view image pairs hinders the
deployment of CVGL in real-life scenarios. Without the pairs, CVGL will be more
challenging to handle the significant imaging and spatial gaps between ground
and satellite images. To this end, we propose an unsupervised framework
including a cross-view projection to guide the model for retrieving initial
pseudo-labels and a fast re-ranking mechanism to refine the pseudo-labels by
leveraging the fact that ``the perfectly paired ground-satellite image is
located in a unique and identical scene". The framework exhibits competitive
performance compared with supervised works on three open-source benchmarks. Our
code and models will be released on https://github.com/liguopeng0923/UCVGL.

disorders in videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS). However, it is
difficult for the model to accurately segment a bolus region in a VFSS image
because VFSS images are translucent, have low contrast and unclear region
boundaries, and lack color information. To overcome these challenges, we
propose PECI-Net, a network architecture for VFSS image analysis that combines
two novel techniques: the preprocessing ensemble network (PEN) and the cascaded
inference network (CIN). PEN enhances the sharpness and contrast of the VFSS
image by combining multiple preprocessing algorithms in a learnable way. CIN
reduces ambiguity in bolus segmentation by using context from other regions
through cascaded inference. Moreover, CIN prevents undesirable side effects
from unreliably segmented regions by referring to the context in an asymmetric
way. In experiments, PECI-Net exhibited higher performance than four recently
developed baseline models, outperforming TernausNet, the best among the
baseline models, by 4.54\% and the widely used UNet by 10.83\%. The results of
the ablation studies confirm that CIN and PEN are effective in improving bolus
segmentation performance.

landscape image using a pre-trained StyleGAN. Inspired by the success of recent
unconditional video generation, we leverage a powerful pre-trained image
generator to synthesize high-quality cinemagraphs. Unlike previous approaches
that mainly utilize the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN, our approach
utilizes its deep feature space for both GAN inversion and cinemagraph
generation. Specifically, we propose multi-scale deep feature warping (MSDFW),
which warps the intermediate features of a pre-trained StyleGAN at different
resolutions. By using MSDFW, the generated cinemagraphs are of high resolution
and exhibit plausible looping animation. We demonstrate the superiority of our
method through user studies and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art
cinemagraph generation methods and a video generation method that uses a
pre-trained StyleGAN.

Language Models (LLMs) to exhibit remarkable capabilities on various
multi-modal tasks in the joint space of vision and language. However, the
Typographic Attack, which disrupts vision-language models (VLMs) such as
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), has also been expected to be a
security threat to LVLMs. Firstly, we verify typographic attacks on current
well-known commercial and open-source LVLMs and uncover the widespread
existence of this threat. Secondly, to better assess this vulnerability, we
propose the most comprehensive and largest-scale Typographic Dataset to date.
The Typographic Dataset not only considers the evaluation of typographic
attacks under various multi-modal tasks but also evaluates the effects of
typographic attacks, influenced by texts generated with diverse factors. Based
on the evaluation results, we investigate the causes why typographic attacks
may impact VLMs and LVLMs, leading to three highly insightful discoveries. By
the examination of our discoveries and experimental validation in the
Typographic Dataset, we reduce the performance degradation from $42.07\%$ to
$13.90\%$ when LVLMs confront typographic attacks.

understanding object relations in images. Specifically, we propose the
All-Seeing Model V2 (ASMv2) that integrates the formulation of text generation,
object localization, and relation comprehension into a relation conversation
(ReC) task. Leveraging this unified task, our model excels not only in
perceiving and recognizing all objects within the image but also in grasping
the intricate relation graph between them, diminishing the relation
hallucination often encountered by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
To facilitate training and evaluation of MLLMs in relation understanding, we
created the first high-quality ReC dataset ({AS-V2) which is aligned with the
format of standard instruction tuning data. In addition, we design a new
benchmark, termed Circular-based Relation Probing Evaluation (CRPE) for
comprehensively evaluating the relation comprehension capabilities of MLLMs.
Notably, our ASMv2 achieves an overall accuracy of 52.04 on this relation-aware
benchmark, surpassing the 43.14 of LLaVA-1.5 by a large margin. We hope that
our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the evolution
towards artificial general intelligence. Our project is released at

                                        <span>  Real-world multi-modal problems are rarely solved by a single machine
learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve
stitching several models. Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for
automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of
standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step
multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions.
Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they
invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like
JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we
introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks
involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and
image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide
automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide
a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly
executable. With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies
(multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3
types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize
takeaways from our extensive experiments. Our dataset and code are available on
HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixianma/mnms) and Github
(https://github.com/RAIVNLab/mnms).

particularly in unpaired scenarios where access to paired image-report data for
training is unavailable. Previous works have typically learned a joint
embedding space for images and reports, necessitating a specific labeling
schema for both. We introduce an innovative approach that eliminates the need
for consistent labeling schemas, thereby enhancing data accessibility and
enabling the use of incompatible datasets. This approach is based on
cycle-consistent mapping functions that transform image embeddings into report
embeddings, coupled with report auto-encoding for medical report generation.
Our model and objectives consider intricate local details and the overarching
semantic context within images and reports. This approach facilitates the
learning of effective mapping functions, resulting in the generation of
coherent reports. It outperforms state-of-the-art results in unpaired chest
X-ray report generation, demonstrating improvements in both language and
clinical metrics.

Addressing this challenge, our study develops an operationally-ready model for
predicting locust breeding grounds, which has the potential to enhance early
warning systems and targeted control measures. We curated a dataset from the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (UN-FAO) locust observation
records and analyzed it using two types of spatio-temporal input features:
remotely-sensed environmental and climate data as well as multi-spectral earth
observation images. Our approach employed custom deep learning models
(three-dimensional and LSTM-based recurrent convolutional networks), along with
the geospatial foundational model Prithvi recently released by Jakubik et al.,
2023. These models notably outperformed existing baselines, with the
Prithvi-based model, fine-tuned on multi-spectral images from NASA's Harmonized
Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, achieving the highest accuracy, F1 and
ROC-AUC scores (83.03%, 81.53% and 87.69%, respectively). A significant finding
from our research is that multi-spectral earth observation images alone are
sufficient for effective locust breeding ground prediction without the need to
explicitly incorporate climatic or environmental features.

                                        <span>  Recent progress in multi-modal conditioned face synthesis has enabled the
creation of visually striking and accurately aligned facial images. Yet,
current methods still face issues with scalability, limited flexibility, and a
one-size-fits-all approach to control strength, not accounting for the
differing levels of conditional entropy, a measure of unpredictability in data
given some condition, across modalities. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel uni-modal training approach with modal surrogates, coupled
with an entropy-aware modal-adaptive modulation, to support flexible, scalable,
and scalable multi-modal conditioned face synthesis network. Our uni-modal
training with modal surrogate that only leverage uni-modal data, use modal
surrogate to decorate condition with modal-specific characteristic and serve as
linker for inter-modal collaboration , fully learns each modality control in
face synthesis process as well as inter-modal collaboration. The entropy-aware
modal-adaptive modulation finely adjust diffusion noise according to
modal-specific characteristics and given conditions, enabling well-informed
step along denoising trajectory and ultimately leading to synthesis results of
high fidelity and quality. Our framework improves multi-modal face synthesis
under various conditions, surpassing current methods in image quality and
fidelity, as demonstrated by our thorough experimental results.

                                        <span>  Medical image classification is a very fundamental and crucial task in the
field of computer vision. These years, CNN-based and Transformer-based models
have been widely used to classify various medical images. Unfortunately, The
limitation of CNNs in long-range modeling capabilities prevents them from
effectively extracting features in medical images, while Transformers are
hampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recent research has shown
that the state space model (SSM) represented by Mamba can efficiently model
long-range interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity.
Inspired by this, we propose Vision Mamba for medical image classification
(MedMamba). More specifically, we introduce a novel Conv-SSM module. Conv-SSM
combines the local feature extraction ability of convolutional layers with the
ability of SSM to capture long-range dependency, thereby modeling medical
images with different modalities. To demonstrate the potential of MedMamba, we
conducted extensive experiments using 14 publicly available medical datasets
with different imaging techniques and two private datasets built by ourselves.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MedMamba performs
well in detecting lesions in various medical images. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first Vision Mamba tailored for medical image
classification. The purpose of this work is to establish a new baseline for
medical image classification tasks and provide valuable insights for the future
development of more efficient and effective SSM-based artificial intelligence
algorithms and application systems in the medical. Source code has been

                                        <span>  As a new embodied vision task, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) aims to
navigate to a specified object depicted by a goal image in an unexplored
environment.
  The main challenge of this task lies in identifying the target object from
different viewpoints while rejecting similar distractors.
  Existing ImageGoal Navigation methods usually adopt the simple
Exploration-Exploitation framework and ignore the identification of specific
instance during navigation.
  In this work, we propose to imitate the human behaviour of ``getting closer
to confirm" when distinguishing objects from a distance.
  Specifically, we design a new modular navigation framework named
Instance-aware Exploration-Verification-Exploitation (IEVE) for instance-level
image goal navigation.
  Our method allows for active switching among the exploration, verification,
and exploitation actions, thereby facilitating the agent in making reasonable
decisions under different situations.
  On the challenging HabitatMatterport 3D semantic (HM3D-SEM) dataset, our
method surpasses previous state-of-the-art work, with a classical segmentation
model (0.684 vs. 0.561 success) or a robust model (0.702 vs. 0.561 success).

of medical image analysis applications, which promises to reshape various
facets of medical practice. Despite early advances in DL model validation and
implementation, which encourage healthcare institutions to adopt them, some
fundamental questions remain: are the DL models capable of generalizing? What
causes a drop in DL model performances? How to overcome the DL model
performance drop? Medical data are dynamic and prone to domain shift, due to
multiple factors such as updates to medical equipment, new imaging workflow,
and shifts in patient demographics or populations can induce this drift over
time. In this paper, we review recent developments in generalization methods
for DL-based classification models. We also discuss future challenges,
including the need for improved evaluation protocols and benchmarks, and
envisioned future developments to achieve robust, generalized models for
medical image classification.

                                        <span>  In the realm of vision-language understanding, the proficiency of models in
interpreting and reasoning over visual content has become a cornerstone for
numerous applications. However, it is challenging for the visual encoder in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to extract useful features tailored to
questions that aid the language model's response. Furthermore, a common
practice among existing LVLMs is to utilize lower-resolution images, which
restricts the ability for visual recognition. Our work introduces the
Chain-of-Spot (CoS) method, which we describe as Interactive Reasoning, a novel
approach that enhances feature extraction by focusing on key regions of
interest (ROI) within the image, corresponding to the posed questions or
instructions. This technique allows LVLMs to access more detailed visual
information without altering the original image resolution, thereby offering
multi-granularity image features. By integrating Chain-of-Spot with
instruct-following LLaVA-1.5 models, the process of image reasoning
consistently improves performance across a wide range of multimodal datasets
and benchmarks without bells and whistles and achieves new state-of-the-art
results. Our empirical findings demonstrate a significant improvement in LVLMs'
ability to understand and reason about visual content, paving the way for more
sophisticated visual instruction-following applications. Code and models are

                                        <span>  The scarcity of annotated data in LiDAR point cloud understanding hinders
effective representation learning. Consequently, scholars have been actively
investigating efficacious self-supervised pre-training paradigms. Nevertheless,
temporal information, which is inherent in the LiDAR point cloud sequence, is
consistently disregarded. To better utilize this property, we propose an
effective pre-training strategy, namely Temporal Masked Auto-Encoders (T-MAE),
which takes as input temporally adjacent frames and learns temporal dependency.
A SiamWCA backbone, containing a Siamese encoder and a windowed cross-attention
(WCA) module, is established for the two-frame input. Considering that the
movement of an ego-vehicle alters the view of the same instance, temporal
modeling also serves as a robust and natural data augmentation, enhancing the
comprehension of target objects. SiamWCA is a powerful architecture but heavily
relies on annotated data. Our T-MAE pre-training strategy alleviates its demand
for annotated data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-MAE achieves
the best performance on both Waymo and ONCE datasets among competitive
self-supervised approaches.

                                        <span>  Accurately modeling detailed interactions between human/hand and object is an
appealing yet challenging task. Current multi-view capture systems are only
capable of reconstructing multiple subjects into a single, unified mesh, which
fails to model the states of each instance individually during interactions. To
address this, previous methods use template-based representations to track
human/hand and object. However, the quality of the reconstructions is limited
by the descriptive capabilities of the templates so that these methods are
inherently struggle with geometry details, pressing deformations and invisible
contact surfaces. In this work, we propose an end-to-end Instance-aware
Human-Object Interactions recovery (Ins-HOI) framework by introducing an
instance-level occupancy field representation. However, the real-captured data
is presented as a holistic mesh, unable to provide instance-level supervision.
To address this, we further propose a complementary training strategy that
leverages synthetic data to introduce instance-level shape priors, enabling the
disentanglement of occupancy fields for different instances. Specifically,
synthetic data, created by randomly combining individual scans of humans/hands
and objects, guides the network to learn a coarse prior of instances.
Meanwhile, real-captured data helps in learning the overall geometry and
restricting interpenetration in contact areas. As demonstrated in experiments,
our method Ins-HOI supports instance-level reconstruction and provides
reasonable and realistic invisible contact surfaces even in cases of extremely
close interaction. To facilitate the research of this task, we collect a
large-scale, high-fidelity 3D scan dataset, including 5.2k high-quality scans
with real-world human-chair and hand-object interactions. The code and data
will be public for research purposes.

                                        <span>  We introduce generative infinite-vocabulary transformers (GIVT) which
generate vector sequences with real-valued entries, instead of discrete tokens
from a finite vocabulary. To this end, we propose two surprisingly simple
modifications to decoder-only transformers: 1) at the input, we replace the
finite-vocabulary lookup table with a linear projection of the input vectors;
and 2) at the output, we replace the logits prediction (usually mapped to a
categorical distribution) with the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian
mixture model. Inspired by the image-generation paradigm of VQ-GAN and MaskGIT,
where transformers are used to model the discrete latent sequences of a VQ-VAE,
we use GIVT to model the unquantized real-valued latent sequences of a
$\beta$-VAE. In class-conditional image generation GIVT outperforms VQ-GAN (and
improved variants thereof) as well as MaskGIT, and achieves performance
competitive with recent latent diffusion models. Finally, we obtain strong
results outside of image generation when applying GIVT to panoptic segmentation
and depth estimation with a VAE variant of the UViM framework

common limitation: they offer increased robustness against attacks at the price
of a considerable accuracy drop on clean samples. In this work, we show how to
efficiently establish, at test-time, a solid tradeoff between robustness and
accuracy when mitigating query-based attacks. Given that these attacks
necessarily explore low-confidence regions, our insight is that activating
dedicated defenses, such as random noise defense and random image
transformations, only for low-confidence inputs is sufficient to prevent them.
Our approach is independent of training and supported by theory. We verify the
effectiveness of our approach for various existing defenses by conducting
extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Our results confirm
that our proposal can indeed enhance these defenses by providing better
tradeoffs between robustness and accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art
approaches while being completely training-free.

importance for autonomous driving systems, wherein class-agnostic motion
prediction methods directly predict the motion of the entire point cloud. While
most existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning, the manual labeling of
point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, several
annotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge.
Although effective, these methods rely on weak annotations or additional
multi-modal data like images, and the potential benefits inherent in the point
cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end, we explore the feasibility
of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds.
Initially, we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse
correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo
motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to
noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses,
which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively. Experimental
results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

                                        <span>  Colonoscopy reconstruction is pivotal for diagnosing colorectal cancer.
However, accurate long-sequence colonoscopy reconstruction faces three major
challenges: (1) dissimilarity among segments of the colon due to its meandering
and convoluted shape; (2) co-existence of simple and intricately folded
geometry structures; (3) sparse viewpoints due to constrained camera
trajectories. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstruction
framework based on neural radiance field (NeRF), named ColonNeRF, which
leverages neural rendering for novel view synthesis of long-sequence
colonoscopy. Specifically, to reconstruct the entire colon in a piecewise
manner, our ColonNeRF introduces a region division and integration module,
effectively reducing shape dissimilarity and ensuring geometric consistency in
each segment. To learn both the simple and complex geometry in a unified
framework, our ColonNeRF incorporates a multi-level fusion module that
progressively models the colon regions from easy to hard. Additionally, to
overcome the challenges from sparse views, we devise a DensiNet module for
densifying camera poses under the guidance of semantic consistency. We conduct
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate our
ColonNeRF. Quantitatively, ColonNeRF exhibits a 67%-85% increase in LPIPS-ALEX
scores. Qualitatively, our reconstruction visualizations show much clearer
textures and more accurate geometric details. These sufficiently demonstrate
our superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  Bio-inspired neuromorphic cameras asynchronously record pixel brightness
changes and generate sparse event streams. They can capture dynamic scenes with
little motion blur and more details in extreme illumination conditions. Due to
the multidimensional address-event structure, most existing vision algorithms
cannot properly handle asynchronous event streams. While several event
representations and processing methods have been developed to address such an
issue, they are typically driven by a large number of events, leading to
substantial overheads in runtime and memory. In this paper, we propose a new
graph representation of the event data and couple it with a Graph Transformer
to perform accurate neuromorphic classification. Extensive experiments show
that our approach leads to better results and excels at the challenging
realistic situations where only a small number of events and limited
computational resources are available, paving the way for neuromorphic
applications embedded into mobile facilities.

                                        <span>  Creating personalized hand avatars is important to offer a realistic
experience to users on AR / VR platforms. While most prior studies focused on
reconstructing 3D hand shapes, some recent work has tackled the reconstruction
of hand textures on top of shapes. However, these methods are often limited to
capturing pixels on the visible side of a hand, requiring diverse views of the
hand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper, we propose a novel
method, BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands), which is the
first end-to-end trainable method for relightable, pose-free texture
reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image, by
three novel components: 1) bi-directional (left $\leftrightarrow$ right)
texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands, 2)
utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery, and 3) the
overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture
of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and
albedo image from an input image, then reconstructs the texture of both hands
through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor.
In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methods
quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Explainable AI is crucial in medical imaging. In the challenging field of
neuroscience, visual topics present a high level of complexity, particularly
within three-dimensional space. The application of neuroscience, which involves
identifying brain sulcal features from MRI, faces significant hurdles due to
varying annotation protocols among experts and the intricate three-dimension
functionality of the brain. Consequently, traditional explainability approaches
fall short in effectively validating and evaluating these networks. To address
this, we first present a mathematical formulation delineating various
categories of explanation needs across diverse computer vision tasks,
categorized into self-explanatory, semi-explanatory, non-explanatory, and
new-pattern learning applications based on the reliability of the validation
protocol. With respect to this mathematical formulation, we propose a 3D
explainability framework aimed at validating the outputs of deep learning
networks in detecting the paracingulate sulcus an essential brain anatomical
feature. The framework integrates local 3D explanations, global explanations
through dimensionality reduction, concatenated global explanations, and
statistical shape features, unveiling new insights into pattern learning. We
trained and tested two advanced 3D deep learning networks on the challenging
TOP-OSLO dataset, significantly improving sulcus detection accuracy,
particularly on the left hemisphere. During evaluation with diverse annotation
protocols for this dataset, we highlighted the crucial role of an unbiased
annotation process in achieving precise predictions and effective pattern
learning within our proposed 3D framework. The proposed framework not only
annotates the variable sulcus but also uncovers hidden AI knowledge, promising
to advance our understanding of brain anatomy and function.

the task of mapping a given query image to one of the 6 million existing
entities in Wikipedia. One way of approaching a problem of such scale is using
dual-encoder models (eg CLIP), where all the entity names and query images are
embedded into a unified space, paving the way for an approximate k-NN search.
Alternatively, it is also possible to re-purpose a captioning model to directly
generate the entity names for a given image. In contrast, we introduce a novel
Generative Entity Recognition (GER) framework, which given an input image
learns to auto-regressively decode a semantic and discriminative ``code''
identifying the target entity. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this
GER paradigm, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on the challenging OVEN
benchmark. GER surpasses strong captioning, dual-encoder, visual matching and
hierarchical classification baselines, affirming its advantage in tackling the
complexities of web-scale recognition.

Inspired by large language models, we examine the abilities of ViTs to perform
various computer vision tasks with little to no fine-tuning. We design
evaluation framework to analyze the quality of local, i.e.\ patch-level,
representations in the context of few-shot semantic segmentation, instance
identification, object retrieval and tracking. We discover that contrastive
learning based methods like DINO produce more universal patch representations
that can be immediately applied for downstream tasks with no parameter tuning,
compared to masked image modeling. The embeddings learned using the latter
approach, e.g. in masked autoencoders, have high variance features that harm
distance-based algorithms, such as k-NN, and do not contain useful information
for most downstream tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that removing these
high-variance features enhances k-NN for MAE, as well as for its recent
extension Scale-MAE. Finally, we find an object instance retrieval setting
where DINOv2, a model pretrained on two orders of magnitude more data, falls
short of its less compute intensive counterpart DINO.

classes with limited training data, while maintaining the performance of
previously learned classes. The main challenges are overfitting the rare new
training samples and forgetting old classes. While catastrophic forgetting has
been extensively studied, the overfitting problem has attracted less attention
in FSCIL. To tackle overfitting challenge, we design a new ensemble model
framework cooperated with data augmentation to boost generalization. In this
way, the enhanced model works as a library storing abundant features to
guarantee fast adaptation to downstream tasks. Specifically, the multi-input
multi-output ensemble structure is applied with a spatial-aware data
augmentation strategy, aiming at diversifying the feature extractor and
alleviating overfitting in incremental sessions. Moreover, self-supervised
learning is also integrated to further improve the model generalization.
Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed method can indeed

methods.

                                        <span>  Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels aims
to achieve segmentation tasks without dense annotations. However, attributed to
the frequent coupling of co-occurring objects and the limited supervision from
image-level labels, the challenging co-occurrence problem is widely present and
leads to false activation of objects in WSSS. In this work, we devise a
'Separate and Conquer' scheme SeCo to tackle this issue from dimensions of
image space and feature space. In the image space, we propose to 'separate' the
co-occurring objects with image decomposition by subdividing images into
patches. Importantly, we assign each patch a category tag from Class Activation
Maps (CAMs), which spatially helps remove the co-context bias and guide the
subsequent representation. In the feature space, we propose to 'conquer' the
false activation by enhancing semantic representation with multi-granularity
knowledge contrast. To this end, a dual-teacher-single-student architecture is
designed and tag-guided contrast is conducted, which guarantee the correctness
of knowledge and further facilitate the discrepancy among co-contexts. We
streamline the multi-staged WSSS pipeline end-to-end and tackle this issue
without external supervision. Extensive experiments are conducted, validating
the efficiency of our method and the superiority over previous single-staged
and even multi-staged competitors on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Code is available

emphasizing the connection between textual context and visual elements.
Recognizing the significance of human faces in news images and the face-name
co-occurrence pattern in existing datasets, we propose a face-naming module for
learning better name embeddings. Apart from names, which can be directly linked
to an image area (faces), news image captions mostly contain context
information that can only be found in the article. We design a retrieval
strategy using CLIP to retrieve sentences that are semantically close to the
image, mimicking human thought process of linking articles to images.
Furthermore, to tackle the problem of the imbalanced proportion of article
context and image context in captions, we introduce a simple yet effective
method Contrasting with Language Model backbone (CoLaM) to the training
pipeline. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our
framework. We out-perform the previous state-of-the-art (without external data)
by 7.97/5.80 CIDEr scores on GoodNews/NYTimes800k. Our code is available at

most images in daily life have features of intensity inhomogeneity and noise.
Therefore, many scholars have designed many image segmentation algorithms to
address these issues. Among them, the active contour model is one of the most
effective image segmentation algorithms.This paper proposes an active contour
model driven by the hybrid signed pressure function that combines global and
local information construction. Firstly, a new global region-based signed
pressure function is introduced by combining the average intensity of the inner
and outer regions of the curve with the median intensity of the inner region of
the evolution curve. Then, the paper uses the energy differences between the
inner and outer regions of the curve in the local region to design the signed
pressure function of the local term. Combine the two SPF function to obtain a
new signed pressure function and get the evolution equation of the new model.
Finally, experiments and numerical analysis show that the model has excellent
segmentation performance for both intensity inhomogeneous images and noisy
images.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in generative AI have unveiled significant potential for the
creation of 3D content. However, current methods either apply a pre-trained 2D
diffusion model with the time-consuming score distillation sampling (SDS), or a
direct 3D diffusion model trained on limited 3D data losing generation
diversity. In this work, we approach the problem by employing a multi-view 2.5D
diffusion fine-tuned from a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. The multi-view 2.5D
diffusion directly models the structural distribution of 3D data, while still
maintaining the strong generalization ability of the original 2D diffusion
model, filling the gap between 2D diffusion-based and direct 3D diffusion-based
methods for 3D content generation. During inference, multi-view normal maps are
generated using the 2.5D diffusion, and a novel differentiable rasterization
scheme is introduced to fuse the almost consistent multi-view normal maps into
a consistent 3D model. We further design a normal-conditioned multi-view image
generation module for fast appearance generation given the 3D geometry. Our
method is a one-pass diffusion process and does not require any SDS
optimization as post-processing. We demonstrate through extensive experiments
that, our direct 2.5D generation with the specially-designed fusion scheme can
achieve diverse, mode-seeking-free, and high-fidelity 3D content generation in
only 10 seconds. Project page: https://nju-3dv.github.io/projects/direct25.

                                        <span>  Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPM) have shown remarkable efficacy in the
synthesis of high-quality images. However, their inference process
characteristically requires numerous, potentially hundreds, of iterative steps,
which could exaggerate the problem of exposure bias due to the training and
inference discrepancy. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by
perturbing inputs during training, which consequently mandates the retraining
of the DPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in DPM
and, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a
novel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model. We
empirically and theoretically show that, during inference, for each backward
time step $t$ and corresponding state $\hat{x}_t$, there might exist another
time step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with $\hat{x}_t$. Based on
this finding, we introduce a sampling method named Time-Shift Sampler. Our
framework can be seamlessly integrated to existing sampling algorithms, such as
DDPM, DDIM and other high-order solvers, inducing merely minimal additional
computations. Experimental results show our method brings significant and
consistent improvements in FID scores on different datasets and sampling
methods. For example, integrating Time-Shift Sampler to F-PNDM yields a
FID=3.88, achieving 44.49\% improvements as compared to F-PNDM, on CIFAR-10
with 10 sampling steps, which is more performant than the vanilla DDIM with 100
sampling steps. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mingxiao-Li/TS-DPM.

                                        <span>  In this work, we tackle the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
for video action recognition. Our approach, which we call UNITE, uses an image
teacher model to adapt a video student model to the target domain. UNITE first
employs self-supervised pre-training to promote discriminative feature learning
on target domain videos using a teacher-guided masked distillation objective.
We then perform self-training on masked target data, using the video student
model and image teacher model together to generate improved pseudolabels for
unlabeled target videos. Our self-training process successfully leverages the
strengths of both models to achieve strong transfer performance across domains.
We evaluate our approach on multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks and
observe significant improvements upon previously reported results.

                                        <span>  We present a novel adversarial penalized self-knowledge distillation method,
named adversarial learning and implicit regularization for self-knowledge
distillation (AI-KD), which regularizes the training procedure by adversarial
learning and implicit distillations. Our model not only distills the
deterministic and progressive knowledge which are from the pre-trained and
previous epoch predictive probabilities but also transfers the knowledge of the
deterministic predictive distributions using adversarial learning. The
motivation is that the self-knowledge distillation methods regularize the
predictive probabilities with soft targets, but the exact distributions may be
hard to predict. Our method deploys a discriminator to distinguish the
distributions between the pre-trained and student models while the student
model is trained to fool the discriminator in the trained procedure. Thus, the
student model not only can learn the pre-trained model's predictive
probabilities but also align the distributions between the pre-trained and
student models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with
network architectures on multiple datasets and show the proposed method
achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  Multiview clustering (MVC) segregates data samples into meaningful clusters
by synthesizing information across multiple views. Moreover, deep
learning-based methods have demonstrated their strong feature learning
capabilities in MVC scenarios. However, effectively generalizing feature
representations while maintaining consistency is still an intractable problem.
In addition, most existing deep clustering methods based on contrastive
learning overlook the consistency of the clustering representations during the
clustering process. In this paper, we show how the above problems can be
overcome and propose a consistent enhancement-based deep MVC method via
contrastive learning (CCEC). Specifically, semantic connection blocks are
incorporated into a feature representation to preserve the consistent
information among multiple views. Furthermore, the representation process for
clustering is enhanced through spectral clustering, and the consistency across
multiple views is improved. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of our method in comparison with the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The code for this method can be accessed at

Moreover, to generate semantically consistent and physically plausible human

effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.

                                        <span>  Weakly-Supervised Scene Graph Generation (WSSGG) research has recently
emerged as an alternative to the fully-supervised approach that heavily relies
on costly annotations. In this regard, studies on WSSGG have utilized image
captions to obtain unlocalized triplets while primarily focusing on grounding
the unlocalized triplets over image regions. However, they have overlooked the
two issues involved in the triplet formation process from the captions: 1)
Semantic over-simplification issue arises when extracting triplets from
captions, where fine-grained predicates in captions are undesirably converted
into coarse-grained predicates, resulting in a long-tailed predicate
distribution, and 2) Low-density scene graph issue arises when aligning the
triplets in the caption with entity/predicate classes of interest, where many
triplets are discarded and not used in training, leading to insufficient
supervision. To tackle the two issues, we propose a new approach, i.e., Large
Language Model for weakly-supervised SGG (LLM4SGG), where we mitigate the two
issues by leveraging the LLM's in-depth understanding of language and reasoning
ability during the extraction of triplets from captions and alignment of
entity/predicate classes with target data. To further engage the LLM in these
processes, we adopt the idea of Chain-of-Thought and the in-context few-shot
learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of LLM4SGG, we conduct
extensive experiments on Visual Genome and GQA datasets, showing significant
improvements in both Recall@K and mean Recall@K compared to the
state-of-the-art WSSGG methods. A further appeal is that LLM4SGG is
data-efficient, enabling effective model training with a small amount of
training images.

decomposition of indoor scenes. Given a single input view, we sample multiple
possible material explanations represented as albedo, roughness, and metallic
maps. Appearance decomposition poses a considerable challenge in computer
vision due to the inherent ambiguity between lighting and material properties
and the lack of real datasets. To address this issue, we advocate for a
probabilistic formulation, where instead of attempting to directly predict the
true material properties, we employ a conditional generative model to sample
from the solution space. Furthermore, we show that utilizing the strong learned
prior of recent diffusion models trained on large-scale real-world images can
be adapted to material estimation and highly improves the generalization to
real images. Our method produces significantly sharper, more consistent, and
more detailed materials, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by $1.5dB$ on
PSNR and by $45\%$ better FID score on albedo prediction. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and

                                        <span>  With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD),
recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning rotated box
(RBox) from the horizontal box (HBox) has attracted more and more attention. In
this paper, we explore a more challenging yet label-efficient setting, namely
single point-supervised OOD, and present our approach called Point2RBox.
Specifically, we propose to leverage two principles: 1) Synthetic pattern
knowledge combination: By sampling around each labeled point on the image, we
spread the object feature to synthetic visual patterns with known boxes to
provide the knowledge for box regression. 2) Transform self-supervision: With a
transformed input image (e.g. scaled/rotated), the output RBoxes are trained to
follow the same transformation so that the network can perceive the relative
size/rotation between objects. The detector is further enhanced by a few
devised techniques to cope with peripheral issues, e.g. the anchor/layer
assignment as the size of the object is not available in our point supervision
setting. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox is the first end-to-end solution for
point-supervised OOD. In particular, our method uses a lightweight paradigm,
yet it achieves a competitive performance among point-supervised alternatives,
41.05%/27.62%/80.01% on DOTA/DIOR/HRSC datasets.

lifelike facial expressions. However, generating realistic, speech-synchronized
robot expressions is challenging due to the complexities of facial biomechanics
and responsive motion synthesis. This paper presents a principled,
skinning-centric approach to drive animatronic robot facial expressions from
speech. The proposed approach employs linear blend skinning (LBS) as the core
representation to guide tightly integrated innovations in embodiment design and
motion synthesis. LBS informs the actuation topology, enables human expression
retargeting, and allows speech-driven facial motion generation. The proposed
approach is capable of generating highly realistic, real-time facial
expressions from speech on an animatronic face, significantly advancing robots'
ability to replicate nuanced human expressions for natural interaction.

                                        <span>  The key to preventing the spread of mpox (monkeypox) lies in timely,
convenient, and accurate diagnosis for earlier-stage infected individuals.
Unfortunately, the resemblances between common skin diseases and mpox and the
need for professional diagnosis inevitably deteriorated the diagnosis of
earlier-stage patients with Mpox and contributed to its widespread outbreak in
crowded areas. Here, we proposed a real-time visualization strategy called
"Super Monitoring" using artificial intelligence and Internet technology,
thereby performing a low-cost, convenient, timely, and unspecialized diagnosis
for earlier-stage mpox. Specifically, such AI-mediated "super monitoring"
(Mpox-AISM) invokes a framework assembled by deep learning models, data
augmentation, self-supervised learning, and cloud services. Verified by
publicly available datasets, the Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1-score
of Mpox-AISM in diagnosing mpox achieved 99.3%, 94.1%, 99.9%, and 96.6%,
respectively. Furthermore, Mpox-AISM's overall accuracy reaches 94.51% in
diagnosing mpox, six like-mpox skin diseases, and normal skin. We also employed
gradient-weighted class activation mapping to explain the decision-making
process of Mpox-AISM, thus handily understanding the specific characteristics
that may indicate the mpox's onset and improving its reliability. With the help
of the Internet and communication terminal, Mpox-AISM can perform a real-time,
low-cost, and convenient diagnosis for earlier-stage mpox in various real-world
settings, thereby effectively curbing the spread of mpox virus.

                                        <span>  Recently, the emergence of the large-scale vision-language model (VLM), such
as CLIP, has opened the way towards open-world object perception. Many works
have explored the utilization of pre-trained VLM for the challenging
open-vocabulary dense prediction task that requires perceiving diverse objects
with novel classes at inference time. Existing methods construct experiments
based on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open
vocabulary and rarely involve imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex
scenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps,
we introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation
(OVCOS), and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\textbf{OVCamo})
containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and corresponding
object classes. Further, we build a strong single-stage open-vocabulary
\underline{c}amouflaged \underline{o}bject \underline{s}egmentation
transform\underline{er} baseline \textbf{OVCoser} attached to the
parameter-fixed CLIP with iterative semantic guidance and structure
enhancement. By integrating the guidance of class semantic knowledge and the
supplement of visual structure cues from the edge and depth information, the
proposed method can efficiently capture camouflaged objects. Moreover, this
effective framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of
open-vocabulary semantic image segmentation by a large margin on our OVCamo
dataset. With the proposed dataset and baseline, we hope that this new task
with more practical value can further expand the research on open-vocabulary
dense prediction tasks. The code and data will be available in the future.

semantics and low-level temporal correspondence. Building on these results, we
take one step further and explore the possibility of integrating these two
features to enhance object-centric representations. Our preliminary experiments
indicate that query slot attention can extract different semantic components
from the RGB feature map, while random sampling based slot attention can
exploit temporal correspondence cues between frames to assist instance
identification. Motivated by this, we propose a novel semantic-aware masked
slot attention on top of the fused semantic features and correspondence maps.
It comprises two slot attention stages with a set of shared learnable Gaussian
distributions. In the first stage, we use the mean vectors as slot
initialization to decompose potential semantics and generate semantic
segmentation masks through iterative attention. In the second stage, for each
semantics, we randomly sample slots from the corresponding Gaussian
distribution and perform masked feature aggregation within the semantic area to
exploit temporal correspondence patterns for instance identification. We adopt
semantic- and instance-level temporal consistency as self-supervision to
encourage temporally coherent object-centric representations. Our model
effectively identifies multiple object instances with semantic structure,
reaching promising results on unsupervised video object discovery. Furthermore,
we achieve state-of-the-art performance on dense label propagation tasks,
demonstrating the potential for object-centric analysis. The code is released
at https://github.com/shvdiwnkozbw/SMTC.

autonomous vehicle at nearby timesteps. Prevalent methods consider scene flow
as point-wise unconstrained flow vectors that can be learned by either
large-scale training beforehand or time-consuming optimization at inference.
However, these methods do not take into account that objects in autonomous
driving often move rigidly. We incorporate this rigid-motion assumption into
our design, where the goal is to associate objects over scans and then estimate
the locally rigid transformations. We propose ICP-Flow, a learning-free flow
estimator. The core of our design is the conventional Iterative Closest Point
(ICP) algorithm, which aligns the objects over time and outputs the
corresponding rigid transformations. Crucially, to aid ICP, we propose a
histogram-based initialization that discovers the most likely translation, thus
providing a good starting point for ICP. The complete scene flow is then
recovered from the rigid transformations. We outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, including supervised models, on the Waymo dataset and perform
competitively on Argoverse-v2 and nuScenes. Further, we train a feedforward
neural network, supervised by the pseudo labels from our model, and achieve top
performance among all models capable of real-time inference. We validate the
advantage of our model on scene flow estimation with longer temporal gaps, up
to 0.4 seconds where other models fail to deliver meaningful results.

                                        <span>  Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) extends the scope of
classic RES to refer to multiple objects in one expression or identify the
empty targets absent in the image. GRES poses challenges in modeling the
complex spatial relationships of the instances in the image and identifying
non-existing referents. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently
shown tremendous progress in these complicated vision-language tasks.
Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models, MLLMs are proficient
in understanding contexts with visual inputs. Among them, LISA, as a
representative, adopts a special [SEG] token to prompt a segmentation mask
decoder, e.g., SAM, to enable MLLMs in the RES task. However, existing
solutions to GRES remain unsatisfactory since current segmentation MLLMs cannot
correctly handle the cases where users might reference multiple subjects in a
singular prompt or provide descriptions incongruent with any image target. In
this paper, we propose Generalized Segmentation Vision Assistant (GSVA) to
address this gap. Specifically, GSVA reuses the [SEG] token to prompt the
segmentation model towards supporting multiple mask references simultaneously
and innovatively learns to generate a [REJ] token to reject the null targets
explicitly. Experiments validate GSVA's efficacy in resolving the GRES issue,
marking a notable enhancement and setting a new record on the GRES benchmark
gRefCOCO dataset. GSVA also proves effective across various classic referring
segmentation and comprehension tasks.

                                        <span>  Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities
to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of
downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic
approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more
computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this
paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation
method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies
its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time
Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of
the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension.
Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the
efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask
separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of
the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior
SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the
number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency
domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary
time-domain counterparts.

masks of the entities that match the descriptive natural language expression.
Previous datasets and methods for classic RES task heavily rely on the prior
assumption that one expression must refer to object-level targets. In this
paper, we take a step further to finer-grained part-level RES task. To promote
the object-level RES task towards finer-grained vision-language understanding,
we put forward a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES)
task and construct an evaluation benchmark called RefCOCOm by manual
annotations. By employing our automatic model-assisted data engine, we build
the largest visual grounding dataset namely MRES-32M, which comprises over
32.2M high-quality masks and captions on the provided 1M images. Besides, a
simple yet strong model named UniRES is designed to accomplish the unified
object-level and part-level grounding task. Extensive experiments on our
RefCOCOm for MRES and three datasets (i.e., RefCOCO(+/g) for classic RES task
demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art
methods. To foster future research into fine-grained visual grounding, our
benchmark RefCOCOm, the MRES-32M dataset and model UniRES will be publicly

(LLMs), their adversarial threat remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we
propose the first adversarial attack tailored for video-based LLMs by crafting
flow-based multi-modal adversarial perturbations on a small fraction of frames
within a video, dubbed FMM-Attack. Extensive experiments show that our attack
can effectively induce video-based LLMs to generate incorrect answers when
videos are added with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Intriguingly,
our FMM-Attack can also induce garbling in the model output, prompting
video-based LLMs to hallucinate. Overall, our observations inspire a further
understanding of multi-modal robustness and safety-related feature alignment
across different modalities, which is of great importance for various large
multi-modal models. Our code is available at

detection, which mainly contain two steps: text kernel segmentation and
expansion. However, the segmentation process only considers each pixel
independently, and the expansion process is difficult to achieve a favorable
accuracy-speed trade-off. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and
Boundary-guided Network (CBN) to tackle these problems. In CBN, a basic text
detector is firstly used to predict initial segmentation results. Then, we
propose a context-aware module to enhance text kernel feature representations,
which considers both global and local contexts. Finally, we introduce a
boundary-guided module to expand enhanced text kernels adaptively with only the
pixels on the contours, which not only obtains accurate text boundaries but
also keeps high speed, especially on high-resolution output maps. In
particular, with a lightweight backbone, the basic detector equipped with our
proposed CBN achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks,
and our proposed CBN can be plugged into several segmentation-based methods.

capability and flexible geometric prompting in general image segmentation.
However, SAM often struggles when handling various unconventional images, such
as aerial, medical, and non-RGB images. This paper presents CAT-SAM, a
ConditionAl Tuning network that adapts SAM toward various unconventional target
tasks with just few-shot target samples. CAT-SAM freezes the entire SAM and
adapts its mask decoder and image encoder simultaneously with a small number of
learnable parameters. The core design is a prompt bridge structure that enables
decoder-conditioned joint tuning of the heavyweight image encoder and the
lightweight mask decoder. The bridging maps the prompt token of the mask
decoder to the image encoder, fostering synergic adaptation of the encoder and
the decoder with mutual benefits. We develop two representative tuning
strategies for the image encoder which leads to two CAT-SAM variants: one
injecting learnable prompt tokens in the input space and the other inserting
lightweight adapter networks. Extensive experiments over 11 unconventional
tasks show that both CAT-SAM variants achieve superior target segmentation
performance consistently even under the very challenging one-shot adaptation
setup. Project page: https://xiaoaoran.github.io/projects/CAT-SAM

                                        <span>  Document shadow is a common issue that arises when capturing documents using
mobile devices, which significantly impacts readability. Current methods
encounter various challenges, including inaccurate detection of shadow masks
and estimation of illumination. In this paper, we propose ShaDocFormer, a
Transformer-based architecture that integrates traditional methodologies and
deep learning techniques to tackle the problem of document shadow removal. The
ShaDocFormer architecture comprises two components: the Shadow-attentive
Threshold Detector (STD) and the Cascaded Fusion Refiner (CFR). The STD module
employs a traditional thresholding technique and leverages the attention
mechanism of the Transformer to gather global information, thereby enabling
precise detection of shadow masks. The cascaded and aggregative structure of
the CFR module facilitates a coarse-to-fine restoration process for the entire
image. As a result, ShaDocFormer excels in accurately detecting and capturing
variations in both shadow and illumination, thereby enabling effective removal
of shadows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaDocFormer outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative
measurements.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce Recon3DMind, an innovative task aimed at
reconstructing 3D visuals from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
signals, marking a significant advancement in the fields of cognitive
neuroscience and computer vision. To support this pioneering task, we present
the fMRI-Shape dataset, which includes data from 14 participants and features
360-degree videos of 3D objects to enable comprehensive fMRI signal capture
across various settings, thereby laying a foundation for future research.
Furthermore, we propose MinD-3D, a novel and effective three-stage framework
specifically designed to decode the brain's 3D visual information from fMRI
signals, demonstrating the feasibility of this challenging task. The framework
begins by extracting and aggregating features from fMRI frames through a
neuro-fusion encoder, subsequently employs a feature bridge diffusion model to
generate visual features, and ultimately recovers the 3D object via a
generative transformer decoder. We assess the performance of MinD-3D using a
suite of semantic and structural metrics and analyze the correlation between
the features extracted by our model and the visual regions of interest (ROIs)
in fMRI signals. Our findings indicate that MinD-3D not only reconstructs 3D
objects with high semantic relevance and spatial similarity but also
significantly enhances our understanding of the human brain's capabilities in
processing 3D visual information. Project page at:

                                        <span>  Stereo matching is a core task for many computer vision and robotics
applications. Despite their dominance in traditional stereo methods, the
hand-crafted Markov Random Field (MRF) models lack sufficient modeling accuracy
compared to end-to-end deep models. While deep learning representations have
greatly improved the unary terms of the MRF models, the overall accuracy is
still severely limited by the hand-crafted pairwise terms and message passing.
To address these issues, we propose a neural MRF model, where both potential
functions and message passing are designed using data-driven neural networks.
Our fully data-driven model is built on the foundation of variational inference
theory, to prevent convergence issues and retain stereo MRF's graph inductive
bias. To make the inference tractable and scale well to high-resolution images,
we also propose a Disparity Proposal Network (DPN) to adaptively prune the
search space of disparity. The proposed approach ranks $1^{st}$ on both KITTI
2012 and 2015 leaderboards among all published methods while running faster
than 100 ms. This approach significantly outperforms prior global methods,
e.g., lowering D1 metric by more than 50% on KITTI 2015. In addition, our
method exhibits strong cross-domain generalization and can recover sharp edges.

in various zero-shot tasks, such as classification and retrieval. Despite their
performance, because improving performance on new tasks requires task-specific
knowledge, their adaptation is essential. While labels are needed for the
adaptation, acquiring them is typically expensive. To overcome this challenge,
active learning, a method of achieving a high performance by obtaining labels
for a small number of samples from experts, has been studied. Active learning
primarily focuses on selecting unlabeled samples for labeling and leveraging
them to train models. In this study, we pose the question, "how can the
pre-trained VLMs be adapted under the active learning framework?" In response
to this inquiry, we observe that (1) simply applying a conventional active
learning framework to pre-trained VLMs even may degrade performance compared to
random selection because of the class imbalance in labeling candidates, and (2)
the knowledge of VLMs can provide hints for achieving the balance before
labeling. Based on these observations, we devise a novel active learning
framework for VLMs, denoted as PCB. To assess the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct experiments on seven different real-world datasets, and
the results demonstrate that PCB surpasses conventional active learning and
random sampling methods. Code will be available in

                                        <span>  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial in computer vision, aiming to
retrieve database images similar to a query image from an extensive collection
of known images. However, like many vision tasks, VPR always degrades at night
due to the scarcity of nighttime images. Moreover, VPR needs to address the
cross-domain problem of night-to-day rather than just the issue of a single
nighttime domain. In response to these issues, we present NocPlace, which
leverages generative and inherited knowledge transfer to embed resilience
against dazzling lights and extreme darkness in the global descriptor. First,
we establish a day-night urban scene dataset called NightCities, capturing
diverse lighting variations and dark scenarios across 60 cities globally. Then,
an image generation network is trained on this dataset and processes a
large-scale VPR dataset, obtaining its nighttime version. Finally, VPR models
are fine-tuned using descriptors inherited from themselves and night-style
images, which builds explicit cross-domain contrastive relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our contributions and
the superiority of NocPlace. Without adding any real-time computing resources,
NocPlace improves the performance of Eigenplaces by 7.6% on Tokyo 24/7 Night
and 16.8% on SVOX Night.

                                        <span>  The current high-fidelity generation and high-precision detection of DeepFake
images are at an arms race. We believe that producing DeepFakes that are highly
realistic and 'detection evasive' can serve the ultimate goal of improving
future generation DeepFake detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images
without hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch
filtering. We first demonstrate that frequency-domain notch filtering, although
famously shown to be effective in removing periodic noise in the spatial
domain, is infeasible for our task at hand due to the manual designs required
for the notch filters. We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach to
reproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. We
adopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the
periodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free
fake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides a
specialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered images
with high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts. Moreover, we also
use the semantic information of the image to generate an adversarial guidance
map to add noise intelligently. Our large-scale evaluation on 3 representative
state-of-the-art DeepFake detection methods (tested on 16 types of DeepFakes)
has demonstrated that our technique significantly reduces the accuracy of these
3 fake image detection methods, 36.79% on average and up to 97.02% in the best
case.

on using discrete speech unit learned from large speech corpora for some tasks.
We submitted our UTDUSS system to two text-to-speech tracks: Vocoder and
Acoustic+Vocoder. Our system incorporates neural audio codec (NAC) pre-trained
on only speech corpora, which makes the learned codec represent rich acoustic
features that are necessary for high-fidelity speech reconstruction. For the
acoustic+vocoder track, we trained an acoustic model based on Transformer
encoder-decoder that predicted the pre-trained NAC tokens from text input. We
describe our strategies to build these models, such as data selection,
downsampling, and hyper-parameter tuning. Our system ranked in second and first
for the Vocoder and Acoustic+Vocoder tracks, respectively.

                                        <span>  Multi-modal emotion recognition has recently gained a lot of attention since
it can leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. Most state-of-the-art methods for
multimodal fusion rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention
mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature of the
modalities. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on
the fusion of facial, vocal, and text modalities extracted from videos.
Specifically, we propose a recursive cross-modal attention (RCMA) to
effectively capture the complementary relationships across the modalities in a
recursive fashion. The proposed model is able to effectively capture the
inter-modal relationships by computing the cross-attention weights across the
individual modalities and the joint representation of the other two modalities.
To further improve the inter-modal relationships, the obtained attended
features of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the cross-modal
attention to refine the feature representations of the individual modalities.
In addition to that, we have used Temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to
capture the temporal modeling (intra-modal relationships) of the individual
modalities. By deploying the TCNs as well cross-modal attention in a recursive
fashion, we are able to effectively capture both intra- and inter-modal
relationships across the audio, visual, and text modalities. Experimental
results on validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our
proposed fusion model is able to achieve significant improvement over the
baseline for the sixth challenge of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild
2024 (ABAW6) competition.

                                        <span>  Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) microphones (mics) with two acoustic
ports are currently receiving considerable interest, with the promise of
achieving higher directional sensitivity compared to traditional one-port
architectures. However, measuring pressure differences in two-port microphones
typically commands sensing elements that are softer than in one-port mics, and
are therefore presumably more prone to interference from external vibration.
Here we derive a universal expression for microphone sensitivity to vibration
and we experimentally demonstrate its validity for several emerging two-port
microphone technologies. We also perform vibration measurements on a one-port
mic, thus providing a one-stop direct comparison between one-port and two-port
sensing approaches. We find that the acoustically-referred vibration
sensitivity of two-port MEMS mics, in units of measured acoustic pressure per
external acceleration (i.e., Pascals per g), does not depend on the sensing
element stiffness nor on its natural frequency. We also show that this
vibration sensitivity in two-port mics is inversely proportional to frequency
as opposed to the frequency independent behavior observed in one-port mics.
This is confirmed experimentally for several types of microphone packages.

information into the factorized neural transducer (FNT) based architecture in
both non-streaming (referred to as LongFNT ) and streaming (referred to as
SLongFNT ) scenarios. We first investigate whether long-content transcriptions
can improve the vanilla conformer transducer (C-T) models. Our experiments
indicate that the vanilla C-T models do not exhibit improved performance when
utilizing long-content transcriptions, possibly due to the predictor network of
C-T models not functioning as a pure language model. Instead, FNT shows its
potential in utilizing long-content information, where we propose the LongFNT
model and explore the impact of long-content information in both text
(LongFNT-Text) and speech (LongFNT-Speech). The proposed LongFNT-Text and
LongFNT-Speech models further complement each other to achieve better
performance, with transcription history proving more valuable to the model. The
effectiveness of our LongFNT approach is evaluated on LibriSpeech and
GigaSpeech corpora, and obtains relative 19% and 12% word error rate reduction,
respectively. Furthermore, we extend the LongFNT model to the streaming
scenario, which is named SLongFNT , consisting of SLongFNT-Text and
SLongFNT-Speech approaches to utilize long-content text and speech information.
Experiments show that the proposed SLongFNT model achieves relative 26% and 17%
WER reduction on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech respectively while keeping a good
latency, compared to the FNT baseline. Overall, our proposed LongFNT and
SLongFNT highlight the significance of considering long-content speech and
transcription knowledge for improving both non-streaming and streaming speech

domains, with a primary focus on overcoming the data limitations. We introduce
KunquDB, a relatively large-scale, well-annotated audio-visual dataset
comprising 339 speakers and 128 hours of content. Originating from the Kunqu
Opera Art Canon (Kunqu yishu dadian), KunquDB is meticulously structured by
dialogue lines, providing explicit annotations including character names,
speaker names, gender information, vocal manner classifications, and
accompanied by preliminary text transcriptions. KunquDB provides a versatile
foundation for role-centric acoustic studies and advancements in speech-related
research, including Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV). Beyond enriching
opera research, this dataset bridges the gap between artistic expression and
technological innovation. Pioneering the exploration of ASV in Chinese opera,
we construct four test trials considering two distinct vocal manners in opera
voices: stage speech (ST) and singing (S). Implementing domain adaptation
methods effectively mitigates domain mismatches induced by these vocal manner
variations while there is still room for further improvement as a benchmark.

                                        <span>  In text-to-speech synthesis, the ability to control voice characteristics is
vital for various applications. By leveraging thriving text prompt-based
generation techniques, it should be possible to enhance the nuanced control of
voice characteristics. While previous research has explored the prompt-based
manipulation of voice characteristics, most studies have used pre-recorded
speech, which limits the diversity of voice characteristics available. Thus, we
aim to address this gap by creating a novel corpus and developing a model for
prompt-based manipulation of voice characteristics in text-to-speech synthesis,
facilitating a broader range of voice characteristics. Specifically, we propose
a method to build a sizable corpus pairing voice characteristics descriptions
with corresponding speech samples. This involves automatically gathering
voice-related speech data from the Internet, ensuring its quality, and manually
annotating it using crowdsourcing. We implement this method with Japanese
language data and analyze the results to validate its effectiveness.
Subsequently, we propose a construction method of the model to retrieve speech
from voice characteristics descriptions based on a contrastive learning method.
We train the model using not only conservative contrastive learning but also
feature prediction learning to predict quantitative speech features
corresponding to voice characteristics. We evaluate the model performance via
experiments with the corpus we constructed above.

                                        <span>  Designing an efficient keyword spotting (KWS) system that delivers
exceptional performance on resource-constrained edge devices has long been a
subject of significant attention. Existing KWS search algorithms typically
follow a frame-synchronous approach, where search decisions are made repeatedly
at each frame despite the fact that most frames are keyword-irrelevant. In this
paper, we propose TDT-KWS, which leverages token-and-duration Transducers (TDT)
for KWS tasks. We also propose a novel KWS task-specific decoding algorithm for
Transducer-based models, which supports highly effective frame-asynchronous
keyword search in streaming speech scenarios. With evaluations conducted on
both the public Hey Snips and self-constructed LibriKWS-20 datasets, our
proposed KWS-decoding algorithm produces more accurate results than
conventional ASR decoding algorithms. Additionally, TDT-KWS achieves on-par or
better wake word detection performance than both RNN-T and traditional TDT-ASR
systems while achieving significant inference speed-up. Furthermore,
experiments show that TDT-KWS is more robust to noisy environments compared to
RNN-T KWS.

                                        <span>  In a typical sound event detection (SED) system, the existence of a sound
event is detected at a frame level, and consecutive frames with the same event
detected are combined as one sound event. The median filter is applied as a
post-processing step to remove detection errors as much as possible. However,
detection errors occurring around the onset and offset of a sound event are
beyond the capacity of the median filter. To address this issue, an onset and
offset weighted binary cross-entropy (OWBCE) loss function is proposed in this
paper, which trains the DNN model to be more robust on frames around (a) onsets
and offsets. Experiments are carried out in the context of DCASE 2022 task 4.
Results show that OWBCE outperforms BCE when different models are considered.
For a basic CRNN, relative improvements of 6.43% in event-F1, 1.96% in PSDS1,
and 2.43% in PSDS2 can be achieved by OWBCE.

                                        <span>  In sound event detection (SED), convolution neural networks (CNNs) are widely
used to extract time-frequency patterns from the input spectrogram. However,
features extracted by CNN can be insensitive to the shift of time-frequency
patterns along the frequency axis. To address this issue, frequency dynamic
convolution (FDY) has been proposed, which applies different kernels to
different frequency components. Compared to the vannila CNN, FDY requires
several times more parameters. In this paper, a more efficient solution named
frequency-aware convolution (FAC) is proposed. In FAC, frequency-positional
information is encoded in a vector and added to the input spectrogram. To match
the amplitude of input, the encoding vector is scaled adaptively and
channel-independently. Experiments are carried out in the context of DCASE 2022
task 4, and the results demonstrate that FAC can achieve comparable performance
to that of FDY with only 515 additional parameters, while FDY requires 8.02
million additional parameters. The ablation study shows that scaling the
encoding vector adaptively and channel-independently is critical to the
performance of FAC.

in the ABAW6 competition. We devised a comprehensive model by preprocessing
video frames and audio segments to extract visual and audio features. Through
the utilization of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules, we effectively
captured the temporal and spatial correlations between these features.
Subsequently, we employed a Transformer encoder structure to learn long-range
dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's performance and generalization
ability. Our method leverages a multimodal data fusion approach, integrating
pre-trained audio and video backbones for feature extraction, followed by
TCN-based spatiotemporal encoding and Transformer-based temporal information
capture. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving competitive performance in VA estimation on the AffWild2 dataset.

                                        <span>  Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly generate music by
constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and
then converting it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder.
Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g.,
16-24 kHz), which limits their effectiveness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an
efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of
three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution
mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth
expansion, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to previous work, we
propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and
training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near
downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast
downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of
monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using both objective
and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or
better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster
inference speed compared to past work. Sound examples are at

                                        <span>  This paper investigates the in-context learning abilities of the Whisper
automatic speech recognition (ASR) models released by OpenAI. A novel
speech-based in-context learning (SICL) approach is proposed for test-time
adaptation, which can reduce the word error rates (WERs) with only a small
number of labelled speech samples without gradient descent. Language-level
adaptation experiments using Chinese dialects showed that when applying SICL to
isolated word ASR, consistent and considerable relative WER reductions can be
achieved using Whisper models of any size on two dialects, which is on average
32.3%. A k-nearest-neighbours-based in-context example selection technique can
be applied to further improve the efficiency of SICL, which can increase the
average relative WER reduction to 36.4%. The findings are verified using
speaker adaptation or continuous speech recognition tasks, and both achieved
considerable relative WER reductions. Detailed quantitative analyses are also
provided to shed light on SICL's adaptability to phonological variances and
dialect-specific lexical nuances.

                                        <span>  This paper works on non-autoregressive automatic speech recognition. A
unimodal aggregation (UMA) is proposed to segment and integrate the feature
frames that belong to the same text token, and thus to learn better feature
representations for text tokens. The frame-wise features and weights are both
derived from an encoder. Then, the feature frames with unimodal weights are
integrated and further processed by a decoder. Connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) loss is applied for training. Compared to the regular CTC,
the proposed method learns better feature representations and shortens the
sequence length, resulting in lower recognition error and computational
complexity. Experiments on three Mandarin datasets show that UMA demonstrates
superior or comparable performance to other advanced non-autoregressive
methods, such as self-conditioned CTC. Moreover, by integrating
self-conditioned CTC into the proposed framework, the performance can be
further noticeably improved.

                                        <span>  Dysarthria is a disability that causes a disturbance in the human speech
system and reduces the quality and intelligibility of a person's speech.
Because of this effect, the normal speech processing systems can not work
properly on impaired speech. This disability is usually associated with
physical disabilities. Therefore, designing a system that can perform some
tasks by receiving voice commands in the smart home can be a significant
achievement. In this work, we introduce gammatonegram as an effective method to
represent audio files with discriminative details, which is used as input for
the convolutional neural network. On the other word, we convert each speech
file into an image and propose image recognition system to classify speech in
different scenarios. Proposed CNN is based on the transfer learning method on
the pre-trained Alexnet. In this research, the efficiency of the proposed
system for speech recognition, speaker identification, and intelligibility
assessment is evaluated. According to the results on the UA dataset, the
proposed speech recognition system achieved 91.29% accuracy in
speaker-dependent mode, the speaker identification system acquired 87.74%
accuracy in text-dependent mode, and the intelligibility assessment system
achieved 96.47% accuracy in two-class mode. Finally, we propose a multi-network
speech recognition system that works fully automatically. This system is
located in a cascade arrangement with the two-class intelligibility assessment
system, and the output of this system activates each one of the speech
recognition networks. This architecture achieves an accuracy of 92.3% WRR. The
source code of this paper is available.

Acoustic+Vocoder. Our system incorporates neural audio codec (NAC) pre-trained
on only speech corpora, which makes the learned codec represent rich acoustic
features that are necessary for high-fidelity speech reconstruction. For the
acoustic+vocoder track, we trained an acoustic model based on Transformer
encoder-decoder that predicted the pre-trained NAC tokens from text input. We
describe our strategies to build these models, such as data selection,
downsampling, and hyper-parameter tuning. Our system ranked in second and first
for the Vocoder and Acoustic+Vocoder tracks, respectively.

                                        <span>  Multi-modal emotion recognition has recently gained a lot of attention since
it can leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. Most state-of-the-art methods for
multimodal fusion rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention
mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature of the
modalities. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on
the fusion of facial, vocal, and text modalities extracted from videos.
Specifically, we propose a recursive cross-modal attention (RCMA) to
effectively capture the complementary relationships across the modalities in a
recursive fashion. The proposed model is able to effectively capture the
inter-modal relationships by computing the cross-attention weights across the
individual modalities and the joint representation of the other two modalities.
To further improve the inter-modal relationships, the obtained attended
features of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the cross-modal
attention to refine the feature representations of the individual modalities.
In addition to that, we have used Temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to
capture the temporal modeling (intra-modal relationships) of the individual
modalities. By deploying the TCNs as well cross-modal attention in a recursive
fashion, we are able to effectively capture both intra- and inter-modal
relationships across the audio, visual, and text modalities. Experimental
results on validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our
proposed fusion model is able to achieve significant improvement over the
baseline for the sixth challenge of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild
2024 (ABAW6) competition.

                                        <span>  Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) microphones (mics) with two acoustic
ports are currently receiving considerable interest, with the promise of
achieving higher directional sensitivity compared to traditional one-port
architectures. However, measuring pressure differences in two-port microphones
typically commands sensing elements that are softer than in one-port mics, and
are therefore presumably more prone to interference from external vibration.
Here we derive a universal expression for microphone sensitivity to vibration
and we experimentally demonstrate its validity for several emerging two-port
microphone technologies. We also perform vibration measurements on a one-port
mic, thus providing a one-stop direct comparison between one-port and two-port
sensing approaches. We find that the acoustically-referred vibration
sensitivity of two-port MEMS mics, in units of measured acoustic pressure per
external acceleration (i.e., Pascals per g), does not depend on the sensing
element stiffness nor on its natural frequency. We also show that this
vibration sensitivity in two-port mics is inversely proportional to frequency
as opposed to the frequency independent behavior observed in one-port mics.
This is confirmed experimentally for several types of microphone packages.

most widely spoken languages in the world, there have been very few studies on
Bengali ASR, particularly on Bangladeshi-accented Bengali. In this study, audio
recordings of spoken digits (0-9) from university students were used to create
a Bengali speech digits dataset that may be employed to train artificial neural

Bengali digit recognition accuracy of several Convolutional Neural Networks

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose two novel approaches, which integrate long-content
information into the factorized neural transducer (FNT) based architecture in
both non-streaming (referred to as LongFNT ) and streaming (referred to as
SLongFNT ) scenarios. We first investigate whether long-content transcriptions
can improve the vanilla conformer transducer (C-T) models. Our experiments
indicate that the vanilla C-T models do not exhibit improved performance when
utilizing long-content transcriptions, possibly due to the predictor network of
C-T models not functioning as a pure language model. Instead, FNT shows its
potential in utilizing long-content information, where we propose the LongFNT
model and explore the impact of long-content information in both text
(LongFNT-Text) and speech (LongFNT-Speech). The proposed LongFNT-Text and
LongFNT-Speech models further complement each other to achieve better
performance, with transcription history proving more valuable to the model. The
effectiveness of our LongFNT approach is evaluated on LibriSpeech and
GigaSpeech corpora, and obtains relative 19% and 12% word error rate reduction,
respectively. Furthermore, we extend the LongFNT model to the streaming
scenario, which is named SLongFNT , consisting of SLongFNT-Text and
SLongFNT-Speech approaches to utilize long-content text and speech information.
Experiments show that the proposed SLongFNT model achieves relative 26% and 17%
WER reduction on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech respectively while keeping a good
latency, compared to the FNT baseline. Overall, our proposed LongFNT and
SLongFNT highlight the significance of considering long-content speech and
transcription knowledge for improving both non-streaming and streaming speech
recognition systems.

domains, with a primary focus on overcoming the data limitations. We introduce
KunquDB, a relatively large-scale, well-annotated audio-visual dataset
comprising 339 speakers and 128 hours of content. Originating from the Kunqu
Opera Art Canon (Kunqu yishu dadian), KunquDB is meticulously structured by
dialogue lines, providing explicit annotations including character names,
speaker names, gender information, vocal manner classifications, and
accompanied by preliminary text transcriptions. KunquDB provides a versatile
foundation for role-centric acoustic studies and advancements in speech-related
research, including Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV). Beyond enriching
opera research, this dataset bridges the gap between artistic expression and
technological innovation. Pioneering the exploration of ASV in Chinese opera,
we construct four test trials considering two distinct vocal manners in opera
voices: stage speech (ST) and singing (S). Implementing domain adaptation
methods effectively mitigates domain mismatches induced by these vocal manner
variations while there is still room for further improvement as a benchmark.

vital for various applications. By leveraging thriving text prompt-based
generation techniques, it should be possible to enhance the nuanced control of
voice characteristics. While previous research has explored the prompt-based
manipulation of voice characteristics, most studies have used pre-recorded
speech, which limits the diversity of voice characteristics available. Thus, we
aim to address this gap by creating a novel corpus and developing a model for
prompt-based manipulation of voice characteristics in text-to-speech synthesis,
facilitating a broader range of voice characteristics. Specifically, we propose
a method to build a sizable corpus pairing voice characteristics descriptions
with corresponding speech samples. This involves automatically gathering
voice-related speech data from the Internet, ensuring its quality, and manually
annotating it using crowdsourcing. We implement this method with Japanese
language data and analyze the results to validate its effectiveness.
Subsequently, we propose a construction method of the model to retrieve speech
from voice characteristics descriptions based on a contrastive learning method.
We train the model using not only conservative contrastive learning but also
feature prediction learning to predict quantitative speech features
corresponding to voice characteristics. We evaluate the model performance via
experiments with the corpus we constructed above.

                                        <span>  Designing an efficient keyword spotting (KWS) system that delivers
exceptional performance on resource-constrained edge devices has long been a
subject of significant attention. Existing KWS search algorithms typically
follow a frame-synchronous approach, where search decisions are made repeatedly
at each frame despite the fact that most frames are keyword-irrelevant. In this
paper, we propose TDT-KWS, which leverages token-and-duration Transducers (TDT)
for KWS tasks. We also propose a novel KWS task-specific decoding algorithm for
Transducer-based models, which supports highly effective frame-asynchronous
keyword search in streaming speech scenarios. With evaluations conducted on
both the public Hey Snips and self-constructed LibriKWS-20 datasets, our
proposed KWS-decoding algorithm produces more accurate results than
conventional ASR decoding algorithms. Additionally, TDT-KWS achieves on-par or
better wake word detection performance than both RNN-T and traditional TDT-ASR
systems while achieving significant inference speed-up. Furthermore,
experiments show that TDT-KWS is more robust to noisy environments compared to
RNN-T KWS.

                                        <span>  In a typical sound event detection (SED) system, the existence of a sound
event is detected at a frame level, and consecutive frames with the same event
detected are combined as one sound event. The median filter is applied as a
post-processing step to remove detection errors as much as possible. However,
detection errors occurring around the onset and offset of a sound event are
beyond the capacity of the median filter. To address this issue, an onset and
offset weighted binary cross-entropy (OWBCE) loss function is proposed in this
paper, which trains the DNN model to be more robust on frames around (a) onsets
and offsets. Experiments are carried out in the context of DCASE 2022 task 4.
Results show that OWBCE outperforms BCE when different models are considered.
For a basic CRNN, relative improvements of 6.43% in event-F1, 1.96% in PSDS1,
and 2.43% in PSDS2 can be achieved by OWBCE.

                                        <span>  Over the years there has been ongoing interest in detecting authorship of a
text based on statistical properties of the text, such as by using occurrence
rates of noncontextual words. In previous work, these techniques have been
used, for example, to determine authorship of all of \emph{The Federalist
Papers}. Such methods may be useful in more modern times to detect fake or AI
authorship. Progress in statistical natural language parsers introduces the
possibility of using grammatical structure to detect authorship. In this paper
we explore a new possibility for detecting authorship using grammatical
structural information extracted using a statistical natural language parser.
This paper provides a proof of concept, testing author classification based on
grammatical structure on a set of "proof texts," The Federalist Papers and
Sanditon which have been as test cases in previous authorship detection
studies. Several features extracted from the statistical natural language
parser were explored: all subtrees of some depth from any level; rooted
subtrees of some depth, part of speech, and part of speech by level in the
parse tree. It was found to be helpful to project the features into a lower
dimensional space. Statistical experiments on these documents demonstrate that
information from a statistical parser can, in fact, assist in distinguishing
authors.

                                        <span>  In sound event detection (SED), convolution neural networks (CNNs) are widely
used to extract time-frequency patterns from the input spectrogram. However,
features extracted by CNN can be insensitive to the shift of time-frequency
patterns along the frequency axis. To address this issue, frequency dynamic
convolution (FDY) has been proposed, which applies different kernels to
different frequency components. Compared to the vannila CNN, FDY requires
several times more parameters. In this paper, a more efficient solution named
frequency-aware convolution (FAC) is proposed. In FAC, frequency-positional
information is encoded in a vector and added to the input spectrogram. To match
the amplitude of input, the encoding vector is scaled adaptively and
channel-independently. Experiments are carried out in the context of DCASE 2022
task 4, and the results demonstrate that FAC can achieve comparable performance
to that of FDY with only 515 additional parameters, while FDY requires 8.02
million additional parameters. The ablation study shows that scaling the
encoding vector adaptively and channel-independently is critical to the
performance of FAC.

                                        <span>  When children learn new words, they employ constraints such as the mutual
exclusivity (ME) bias: a novel word is mapped to a novel object rather than a
familiar one. This bias has been studied computationally, but only in models
that use discrete word representations as input, ignoring the high variability
of spoken words. We investigate the ME bias in the context of visually grounded
speech models that learn from natural images and continuous speech audio.
Concretely, we train a model on familiar words and test its ME bias by asking
it to select between a novel and a familiar object when queried with a novel
word. To simulate prior acoustic and visual knowledge, we experiment with
several initialisation strategies using pretrained speech and vision networks.
Our findings reveal the ME bias across the different initialisation approaches,
with a stronger bias in models with more prior (in particular, visual)
knowledge. Additional tests confirm the robustness of our results, even when
different loss functions are considered.

modules, namely, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Neural Machine Translation
(NMT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS). Within AVD pipelines, isometric-NMT algorithms
are employed to regulate the length of the synthesized output text. This is
done to guarantee synchronization with respect to the alignment of video and
audio subsequent to the dubbing process. Previous approaches have focused on
aligning the number of characters and words in the source and target language
texts of Machine Translation models. However, our approach aims to align the
number of phonemes instead, as they are closely associated with speech
duration. In this paper, we present the development of an isometric NMT system
using Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a focus on optimizing the alignment of
phoneme counts in the source and target language sentence pairs. To evaluate
our models, we propose the Phoneme Count Compliance (PCC) score, which is a
measure of length compliance. Our approach demonstrates a substantial
improvement of approximately 36% in the PCC score compared to the
state-of-the-art models when applied to English-Hindi language pairs. Moreover,
we propose a student-teacher architecture within the framework of our RL
approach to maintain a trade-off between the phoneme count and translation
quality.

in the ABAW6 competition. We devised a comprehensive model by preprocessing

the utilization of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules, we effectively
captured the temporal and spatial correlations between these features.
Subsequently, we employed a Transformer encoder structure to learn long-range

ability. Our method leverages a multimodal data fusion approach, integrating
pre-trained audio and video backbones for feature extraction, followed by
TCN-based spatiotemporal encoding and Transformer-based temporal information
capture. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,

                                        <span>  Sound event localization and detection (SELD) involves sound event detection
(SED) and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation tasks. SED mainly relies on
temporal dependencies to distinguish different sound classes, while DoA
estimation depends on spatial correlations to estimate source directions. This
paper addresses the need to simultaneously extract spatial-temporal information
in audio signals to improve SELD performance. A novel block, the sliding-window
graph-former (SwG-former), is designed to learn temporal context information of
sound events based on their spatial correlations. The SwG-former block
transforms audio signals into a graph representation and constructs graph
vertices to capture higher abstraction levels for spatial correlations. It uses
different-sized sliding windows to adapt various sound event durations and
aggregates temporal features with similar spatial information while
incorporating multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to model global information.
Furthermore, as the cornerstone of message passing, a robust Conv2dAgg function
is proposed and embedded into the block to aggregate the features of neighbor
vertices. As a result, a SwG-former model, which stacks the SwG-former blocks,
demonstrates superior performance compared to recent advanced SELD models. The
SwG-former block is also integrated into the event-independent network version
2 (EINV2), called SwG-EINV2, which surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods under the same acoustic environment.

                                        <span>  Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly generate music by
constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and
then converting it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder.
Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g.,
16-24 kHz), which limits their effectiveness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an
efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of
three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution
mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth
expansion, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to previous work, we
propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and
training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near
downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast
downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of
monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using both objective
and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or
better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster
inference speed compared to past work. Sound examples are at

automatic speech recognition (ASR) models released by OpenAI. A novel
speech-based in-context learning (SICL) approach is proposed for test-time
adaptation, which can reduce the word error rates (WERs) with only a small
number of labelled speech samples without gradient descent. Language-level
adaptation experiments using Chinese dialects showed that when applying SICL to
isolated word ASR, consistent and considerable relative WER reductions can be
achieved using Whisper models of any size on two dialects, which is on average
32.3%. A k-nearest-neighbours-based in-context example selection technique can
be applied to further improve the efficiency of SICL, which can increase the
average relative WER reduction to 36.4%. The findings are verified using
speaker adaptation or continuous speech recognition tasks, and both achieved
considerable relative WER reductions. Detailed quantitative analyses are also
provided to shed light on SICL's adaptability to phonological variances and
dialect-specific lexical nuances.

unimodal aggregation (UMA) is proposed to segment and integrate the feature
frames that belong to the same text token, and thus to learn better feature
representations for text tokens. The frame-wise features and weights are both
derived from an encoder. Then, the feature frames with unimodal weights are
integrated and further processed by a decoder. Connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) loss is applied for training. Compared to the regular CTC,
the proposed method learns better feature representations and shortens the
sequence length, resulting in lower recognition error and computational
complexity. Experiments on three Mandarin datasets show that UMA demonstrates
superior or comparable performance to other advanced non-autoregressive
methods, such as self-conditioned CTC. Moreover, by integrating
self-conditioned CTC into the proposed framework, the performance can be
further noticeably improved.

                                        <span>  Dysarthria is a disability that causes a disturbance in the human speech
system and reduces the quality and intelligibility of a person's speech.
Because of this effect, the normal speech processing systems can not work
properly on impaired speech. This disability is usually associated with
physical disabilities. Therefore, designing a system that can perform some
tasks by receiving voice commands in the smart home can be a significant
achievement. In this work, we introduce gammatonegram as an effective method to
represent audio files with discriminative details, which is used as input for
the convolutional neural network. On the other word, we convert each speech
file into an image and propose image recognition system to classify speech in
different scenarios. Proposed CNN is based on the transfer learning method on
the pre-trained Alexnet. In this research, the efficiency of the proposed
system for speech recognition, speaker identification, and intelligibility
assessment is evaluated. According to the results on the UA dataset, the
proposed speech recognition system achieved 91.29% accuracy in
speaker-dependent mode, the speaker identification system acquired 87.74%
accuracy in text-dependent mode, and the intelligibility assessment system
achieved 96.47% accuracy in two-class mode. Finally, we propose a multi-network
speech recognition system that works fully automatically. This system is
located in a cascade arrangement with the two-class intelligibility assessment
system, and the output of this system activates each one of the speech
recognition networks. This architecture achieves an accuracy of 92.3% WRR. The
source code of this paper is available.

by the number of unique samples, on the performance of self-supervised learning

that increasing pretraining data diversity enhances SSL performance, albeit
only when the distribution distance to the downstream data is minimal. Notably,
even with an exceptionally large pretraining data diversity achieved through

copyrighted, incorrect, and biased content. While previous methods have
mitigated the issues on a small scale, it is essential to handle them
simultaneously in larger-scale real-world scenarios. We propose a two-stage
method, Editing Massive Concepts In Diffusion Models (EMCID). The first stage
performs memory optimization for each individual concept with dual
self-distillation from text alignment loss and diffusion noise prediction loss.
The second stage conducts massive concept editing with multi-layer, closed form
model editing. We further propose a comprehensive benchmark, named ImageNet
Concept Editing Benchmark (ICEB), for evaluating massive concept editing for
T2I models with two subtasks, free-form prompts, massive concept categories,
and extensive evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments conducted on our
proposed benchmark and previous benchmarks demonstrate the superior scalability
of EMCID for editing up to 1,000 concepts, providing a practical approach for
fast adjustment and re-deployment of T2I diffusion models in real-world
applications.

noise image-text pairs to excel at recognizing a wide array of candidates, yet
its focus on broad associations hinders the precision in distinguishing subtle
differences among fine-grained items. Conversely, Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) excel at classifying fine-grained categories, thanks to their
substantial knowledge from pre-training on web-level corpora. However, the
performance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily
due to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To
synergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot
recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained
vocabularies, this paper introduces RAR, a Retrieving And Ranking augmented
method for MLLMs. We initially establish a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP
to create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the
immediate context window. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-k similar
results from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions.
Our proposed approach not only addresses the inherent limitations in
fine-grained recognition but also preserves the model's comprehensive knowledge
base, significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language
recognition tasks. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement
in performance on 5 fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, 11 few-shot
image recognition datasets, and the 2 object detection datasets under the
zero-shot recognition setting.

photorealistic quality at impressive rendering speeds. While Radiance
Field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios
such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from
excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian
Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally
achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics
that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present
RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex
scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as
a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene
representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization.
Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count
while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene
representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel
test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to
scale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables
state-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS.

and knowledge transfer from various large-scale pretrained models to enhance
the visual grounding capabilities of a pretrained vision-and-language model.
The knowledge transfer from the models initiates the generation of image
descriptions through an image description generator. These descriptions serve
dual purposes: they act as prompts for synthesizing images through a
text-to-image generator, and as queries for synthesizing text, from which
phrases are extracted using a large language model. Finally, we leverage an
open-vocabulary object detector to generate synthetic bounding boxes for the
synthetic images and texts. We finetune a pretrained vision-and-language model
on this dataset by optimizing a mask-attention consistency objective that
aligns region annotations with gradient-based model explanations. The resulting
model improves the grounding capabilities of an off-the-shelf
vision-and-language model. Particularly, SynGround improves the pointing game
accuracy of ALBEF on the Flickr30k dataset from 79.38% to 87.26%, and on
RefCOCO+ Test A from 69.35% to 79.06% and on RefCOCO+ Test B from 53.77% to

                                        <span>  Bounding boxes uniquely characterize object detection, where a good detector
gives accurate bounding boxes of categories of interest. However, in the
real-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find
out whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the
detector generalization ability. In this work, we find under feature map
dropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not
change much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable
position changes. We compute the box stability score (BoS score) to reflect
this stability. Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of
bounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout. To obtain BoS score,
we use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets
and compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test
set. We contribute to finding that BoS score has a strong, positive correlation
with detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various
test environments. This relationship allows us to predict the accuracy of
detectors on various real-world test sets without accessing test ground truths,
verified on canonical detection tasks such as vehicle detection and pedestrian
detection. Code and data are available at https://github.com/YangYangGirl/BoS.

                                        <span>  The diffusion model has long been plagued by scalability and quadratic
complexity issues, especially within transformer-based structures. In this
study, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of a
State-Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to visual data
generation. Firstly, we identify a critical oversight in most current
Mamba-based vision methods, namely the lack of consideration for spatial
continuity in the scan scheme of Mamba. Secondly, building upon this insight,
we introduce a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter method named Zigzag Mamba,
which outperforms Mamba-based baselines and demonstrates improved speed and
memory utilization compared to transformer-based baselines. Lastly, we
integrate Zigzag Mamba with the Stochastic Interpolant framework to investigate
the scalability of the model on large-resolution visual datasets, such as
FacesHQ $1024\times 1024$ and UCF101, MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, and MS COCO
$256\times 256$. Code will be released at https://taohu.me/zigma/

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the novel challenge of ``rewinding'' time from a single
captured image to recover the fleeting moments missed just before the shutter
button is pressed. This problem poses a significant challenge in computer
vision and computational photography, as it requires predicting plausible
pre-capture motion from a single static frame, an inherently ill-posed task due
to the high degree of freedom in potential pixel movements. We overcome this
challenge by leveraging the emerging technology of neuromorphic event cameras,
which capture motion information with high temporal resolution, and integrating
this data with advanced image-to-video diffusion models. Our proposed framework
introduces an event motion adaptor conditioned on event camera data, guiding
the diffusion model to generate videos that are visually coherent and
physically grounded in the captured events. Through extensive experimentation,
we demonstrate the capability of our approach to synthesize high-quality videos
that effectively ``rewind'' time, showcasing the potential of combining event
camera technology with generative models. Our work opens new avenues for
research at the intersection of computer vision, computational photography, and
generative modeling, offering a forward-thinking solution to capturing missed
moments and enhancing future consumer cameras and smartphones. Please see the

                                        <span>  Action quality assessment (AQA) applies computer vision to quantitatively
assess the performance or execution of a human action. Current AQA approaches
are end-to-end neural models, which lack transparency and tend to be biased
because they are trained on subjective human judgements as ground-truth. To
address these issues, we introduce a neuro-symbolic paradigm for AQA, which
uses neural networks to abstract interpretable symbols from video data and
makes quality assessments by applying rules to those symbols. We take diving as
the case study. We found that domain experts prefer our system and find it more
informative than purely neural approaches to AQA in diving. Our system also
achieves state-of-the-art action recognition and temporal segmentation, and
automatically generates a detailed report that breaks the dive down into its
elements and provides objective scoring with visual evidence. As verified by a
group of domain experts, this report may be used to assist judges in scoring,
help train judges, and provide feedback to divers. We will open-source all of
our annotated training data and code for ease of reproducibility.

                                        <span>  Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot image classification by
pairing images with textual category names. The expanding variety of
Pre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for
specific tasks. Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is
selecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely
on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images.
In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a
VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the "Modality Gap" -- the disparity in
VLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable
substitute for images; and the "Capability Gap" -- the discrepancy between the
VLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct
prediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general
performance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the
negative impact of these two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to
capture the relevance between open-source datasets and target dataset with a
transportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics
of VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging those two
gaps and enhancing the VLM's capacity estimation for VLM selection. Experiments
across various VLMs and image classification datasets validate SWAB's
effectiveness.

                                        <span>  Monocular depth estimation is crucial for numerous downstream vision tasks
and applications. Current discriminative approaches to this problem are limited
due to blurry artifacts, while state-of-the-art generative methods suffer from
slow sampling due to their SDE nature. Rather than starting from noise, we seek
a direct mapping from input image to depth map. We observe that this can be
effectively framed using flow matching, since its straight trajectories through
solution space offer efficiency and high quality. Our study demonstrates that a
pre-trained image diffusion model can serve as an adequate prior for a flow
matching depth model, allowing efficient training on only synthetic data to
generalize to real images. We find that an auxiliary surface normals loss
further improves the depth estimates. Due to the generative nature of our
approach, our model reliably predicts the confidence of its depth estimates. On
standard benchmarks of complex natural scenes, our lightweight approach
exhibits state-of-the-art performance at favorable low computational cost
despite only being trained on little synthetic data.

numerous strategies have been developed to enhance the robustness of trajectory
prediction models, these methods are predominantly heuristic and do not offer
guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy observations. In
this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for the task of
trajectory prediction. To this end, we address the inherent challenges
associated with trajectory prediction, including unbounded outputs, and
mutli-modality, resulting in a model that provides guaranteed robustness.
Furthermore, we integrate a denoiser into our method to further improve the
performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed technique across various baselines and using
standard trajectory prediction datasets. The code will be made available

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose Describe-and-Dissect (DnD), a novel method to
describe the roles of hidden neurons in vision networks. DnD utilizes recent
advancements in multimodal deep learning to produce complex natural language
descriptions, without the need for labeled training data or a predefined set of
concepts to choose from. Additionally, DnD is training-free, meaning we don't
train any new models and can easily leverage more capable general purpose
models in the future. We have conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative
analysis to show that DnD outperforms prior work by providing higher quality
neuron descriptions. Specifically, our method on average provides the highest
quality labels and is more than 2 times as likely to be selected as the best
explanation for a neuron than the best baseline.

which is abundantly available for tasks such as game agents and software
testing. Even though significant empirical advances have been made on this
problem, a theoretical understanding remains absent. We initiate the
theoretical investigation into principled approaches for representation
learning and focus on learning the latent state representations of the
underlying MDP using video data. We study two types of settings: one where
there is iid noise in the observation, and a more challenging setting where
there is also the presence of exogenous noise, which is non-iid noise that is
temporally correlated, such as the motion of people or cars in the background.
We study three commonly used approaches: autoencoding, temporal contrastive
learning, and forward modeling. We prove upper bounds for temporal contrastive
learning and forward modeling in the presence of only iid noise. We show that
these approaches can learn the latent state and use it to do efficient
downstream RL with polynomial sample complexity. When exogenous noise is also
present, we establish a lower bound result showing that the sample complexity
of learning from video data can be exponentially worse than learning from
action-labeled trajectory data. This partially explains why reinforcement
learning with video pre-training is hard. We evaluate these representational
learning methods in two visual domains, yielding results that are consistent
with our theoretical findings.

                                        <span>  The majority of recent progress in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has been
achieved with Deep Learning methods, especially models following the end-to-end
paradigm, reading input images and producing a linear sequence of tokens.
Unfortunately, many music scores, especially piano music, cannot be easily
converted to a linear sequence. This has led OMR researchers to use custom
linearized encodings, instead of broadly accepted structured formats for music
notation. Their diversity makes it difficult to compare the performance of OMR
systems directly. To bring recent OMR model progress closer to useful results:
(a) We define a sequential format called Linearized MusicXML, allowing to train
an end-to-end model directly and maintaining close cohesion and compatibility
with the industry-standard MusicXML format. (b) We create a dev and test set
for benchmarking typeset OMR with MusicXML ground truth based on the OpenScore
Lieder corpus. They contain 1,438 and 1,493 pianoform systems, each with an
image from IMSLP. (c) We train and fine-tune an end-to-end model to serve as a
baseline on the dataset and employ the TEDn metric to evaluate the model. We
also test our model against the recently published synthetic pianoform dataset
GrandStaff and surpass the state-of-the-art results.

challenges due to its intricate character structures and vast vocabulary.
Traditional one-hot encoding methods struggle with the representation of
hierarchical radicals, recognition of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) characters, and
on-device deployment due to their computational intensity. To address these
challenges, we propose HierCode, a novel and lightweight codebook that exploits
the innate hierarchical nature of Chinese characters. HierCode employs a
multi-hot encoding strategy, leveraging hierarchical binary tree encoding and
prototype learning to create distinctive, informative representations for each
character. This approach not only facilitates zero-shot recognition of OOV
characters by utilizing shared radicals and structures but also excels in
line-level recognition tasks by computing similarity with visual features, a
notable advantage over existing methods. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, including handwritten, scene, document, web, and ancient text, have
showcased HierCode's superiority for both conventional and zero-shot Chinese
character or text recognition, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance with
significantly fewer parameters and fast inference speed.

model without sharing private data. In semantic segmentation, the Federated
source Free Domain Adaptation (FFreeDA) setting is of particular interest,
where clients undergo unsupervised training after supervised pretraining at the
server side. While few recent works address FL for autonomous vehicles,
intrinsic real-world challenges such as the presence of adverse weather
conditions and the existence of different autonomous agents are still
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we address both problems and introduce a new
federated semantic segmentation setting where both car and drone clients
co-exist and collaborate. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for this
setting which exploits a batch-norm weather-aware strategy to dynamically adapt
the model to the different weather conditions, while hyperbolic space
prototypes are used to align the heterogeneous client representations. Finally,
we introduce FLYAWARE, the first semantic segmentation dataset with adverse
weather data for aerial vehicles.

prompt learning. Second, we integrate the paired gait parameters in the form of
numerical texts to enhance the numeracy of the textual representation. Results
demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

                                        <span>  Deep hashing techniques have emerged as the predominant approach for
efficient image retrieval. Traditionally, these methods utilize pre-trained
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and VGG-16 as feature
extractors. However, the increasing complexity of datasets poses challenges for
these backbone architectures in capturing meaningful features essential for
effective image retrieval. In this study, we explore the efficacy of employing
high-resolution features learned through state-of-the-art techniques for image
retrieval tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel methodology that utilizes
High-Resolution Networks (HRNets) as the backbone for the deep hashing task,
termed High-Resolution Hashing Network (HHNet). Our approach demonstrates
superior performance compared to existing methods across all tested benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, MS COCO, and ImageNet. This performance
improvement is more pronounced for complex datasets, which highlights the need
to learn high-resolution features for intricate image retrieval tasks.
Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of different HRNet
configurations and provide insights into the optimal architecture for the deep

                                        <span>  Video outpainting is a challenging task, aiming at generating video content
outside the viewport of the input video while maintaining inter-frame and
intra-frame consistency. Existing methods fall short in either generation
quality or flexibility. We introduce MOTIA Mastering Video Outpainting Through
Input-Specific Adaptation, a diffusion-based pipeline that leverages both the
intrinsic data-specific patterns of the source video and the image/video
generative prior for effective outpainting. MOTIA comprises two main phases:
input-specific adaptation and pattern-aware outpainting. The input-specific
adaptation phase involves conducting efficient and effective pseudo outpainting
learning on the single-shot source video. This process encourages the model to
identify and learn patterns within the source video, as well as bridging the
gap between standard generative processes and outpainting. The subsequent
phase, pattern-aware outpainting, is dedicated to the generalization of these
learned patterns to generate outpainting outcomes. Additional strategies
including spatial-aware insertion and noise travel are proposed to better
leverage the diffusion model's generative prior and the acquired video patterns
from source videos. Extensive evaluations underscore MOTIA's superiority,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in widely recognized
benchmarks. Notably, these advancements are achieved without necessitating
extensive, task-specific tuning.

with state-of-the-art methods leveraging deep neural networks for better
robustness and applicability. However, there is a lack of research in fusing
these learning-based methods with multi-sensor information, which could be
indispensable to push related applications to large-scale and complex
scenarios. In this paper, we tightly integrate the trainable deep dense bundle
adjustment (DBA) with multi-sensor information through a factor graph. In the
framework, recurrent optical flow and DBA are performed among sequential
images. The Hessian information derived from DBA is fed into a generic factor
graph for multi-sensor fusion, which employs a sliding window and supports
probabilistic marginalization. A pipeline for visual-inertial integration is
firstly developed, which provides the minimum ability of metric-scale
localization and mapping. Furthermore, other sensors (e.g., global navigation
satellite system) are integrated for driftless and geo-referencing
functionality. Extensive tests are conducted on both public datasets and
self-collected datasets. The results validate the superior localization
performance of our approach, which enables real-time dense mapping in
large-scale environments. The code has been made open-source

                                        <span>  Transmission line detection technology is crucial for automatic monitoring
and ensuring the safety of electrical facilities. The YOLOv5 series is
currently one of the most advanced and widely used methods for object
detection. However, it faces inherent challenges, such as high computational
load on devices and insufficient detection accuracy. To address these concerns,
this paper presents an enhanced lightweight YOLOv5 technique customized for
mobile devices, specifically intended for identifying objects associated with
transmission lines. The C3Ghost module is integrated into the convolutional
network of YOLOv5 to reduce floating point operations per second (FLOPs) in the
feature channel fusion process and improve feature expression performance. In
addition, a FasterNet module is introduced to replace the c3 module in the
YOLOv5 Backbone. The FasterNet module uses Partial Convolutions to process only
a portion of the input channels, improving feature extraction efficiency and
reducing computational overhead. To address the imbalance between simple and
challenging samples in the dataset and the diversity of aspect ratios of
bounding boxes, the wIoU v3 LOSS is adopted as the loss function. To validate
the performance of the proposed approach, Experiments are conducted on a custom
dataset of transmission line poles. The results show that the proposed model
achieves a 1% increase in detection accuracy, a 13% reduction in FLOPs, and a
26% decrease in model parameters compared to the existing YOLOv5.In the
ablation experiment, it was also discovered that while the Fastnet module and
the CSghost module improved the precision of the original YOLOv5 baseline
model, they caused a decrease in the mAP@.5-.95 metric. However, the
improvement of the wIoUv3 loss function significantly mitigated the decline of
the mAP@.5-.95 metric.

indispensable solution for maritime surveillance. However, applying DL models
trained on one dataset to others having differences in spatial resolution and
radiometric features requires many adjustments. To overcome this issue, this
paper focused on the DL models trained on datasets that consist of different
optical images and a combination of radar and optical data. When dealing with a
limited number of training images, the performance of DL models via this
approach was satisfactory. They could improve 5-20% of average precision,
depending on the optical images tested. Likewise, DL models trained on the
combined optical and radar dataset could be applied to both optical and radar
images. Our experiments showed that the models trained on an optical dataset
could be used for radar images, while those trained on a radar dataset offered
very poor scores when applied to optical images.

                                        <span>  Recent research has begun to examine the potential of automatically finding
and fixing accessibility issues that manifest in software. However, while
recent work makes important progress, it has generally been skewed toward
identifying issues that affect users with certain disabilities, such as those
with visual or hearing impairments. However, there are other groups of users
with different types of disabilities that also need software tooling support to
improve their experience. As such, this paper aims to automatically identify
accessibility issues that affect users with motor-impairments.
  To move toward this goal, this paper introduces a novel approach, called
MotorEase, capable of identifying accessibility issues in mobile app UIs that
impact motor-impaired users. Motor-impaired users often have limited ability to
interact with touch-based devices, and instead may make use of a switch or
other assistive mechanism -- hence UIs must be designed to support both limited
touch gestures and the use of assistive devices. MotorEase adapts computer
vision and text processing techniques to enable a semantic understanding of app
UI screens, enabling the detection of violations related to four popular,
previously unexplored UI design guidelines that support motor-impaired users,
including: (i) visual touch target size, (ii) expanding sections, (iii)
persisting elements, and (iv) adjacent icon visual distance. We evaluate
MotorEase on a newly derived benchmark, called MotorCheck, that contains 555
manually annotated examples of violations to the above accessibility
guidelines, across 1599 screens collected from 70 applications via a mobile app
testing tool. Our experiments illustrate that MotorEase is able to identify
violations with an average accuracy of ~90%, and a false positive rate of less
than 9%, outperforming baseline techniques.

                                        <span>  Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabelled images from
both `seen' and `unseen' classes by transferring knowledge from a set of
labelled `seen' class images. A key theme in existing GCD approaches is
adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate
perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better
alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a
two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model
parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt
learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT)
which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to
better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen
classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find
our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly
remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of
those in the backbone architecture. Project page:

                                        <span>  Determining the relative pose of an object between two images is pivotal to
the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches
typically approximate the continuous pose representation with a large number of
discrete pose hypotheses, which incurs a computationally expensive process of
scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we present a Deep Voxel
Matching Network (DVMNet) that eliminates the need for pose hypotheses and
computes the relative object pose in a single pass. To this end, we map the two
input RGB images, reference and query, to their respective voxelized 3D
representations. We then pass the resulting voxels through a pose estimation
module, where the voxels are aligned and the pose is computed in an end-to-end
fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce
a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy
voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, LINEMOD, and Objaverse
datasets, demonstrating that our method delivers more accurate relative pose
estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at:

                                        <span>  High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care.
Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to
evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection,
brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately,
optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and
absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment.
Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the
sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and
tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired
low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated
Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image
restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based
image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically
determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to
complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms
other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and
perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging
experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison
experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD
improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated
brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging. Our code is available at

understanding human emotions and behaviors, especially in in-the-wild setting.
Traditional methods for integrating such multimodal information often stumble,
leading to less-than-ideal outcomes in the task of facial action unit
detection. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel approach
utilizing audio-visual multimodal data. This method enhances audio feature
extraction by leveraging Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Log-Mel
spectrogram features alongside a pre-trained VGGish network. Moreover, this
paper adaptively captures fusion features across modalities by modeling the
temporal relationships, and ultilizes a pre-trained GPT-2 model for
sophisticated context-aware fusion of multimodal information. Our method
notably improves the accuracy of AU detection by understanding the temporal and
contextual nuances of the data, showcasing significant advancements in the
comprehension of intricate scenarios. These findings underscore the potential
of integrating temporal dynamics and contextual interpretation, paving the way
for future research endeavors.

combine the information from both to form a visual scene. Drawing on this
neuroscientific inspiration, we propose an altered Vision Transformer
architecture where patches from scaled down versions of the input image are
added to the input of the first Transformer Encoder layer. We name this model
Retina Vision Transformer (RetinaViT) due to its inspiration from the human
visual system. Our experiments show that when trained on the ImageNet-1K
dataset with a moderate configuration, RetinaViT achieves a 3.3% performance
improvement over the original ViT. We hypothesize that this improvement can be
attributed to the inclusion of low spatial frequency components in the input,
which improves the ability to capture structural features, and to select and
forward important features to deeper layers. RetinaViT thereby opens doors to
further investigations into vertical pathways and attention patterns.

the final presentation of dances. Recently, various methods and datasets have
showcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However, camera movement
synthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to
the scarcity of paired data. Thus, we present DCM, a new multi-modal 3D
dataset, which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion
and music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of
paired dance-camera-music data from the anime community, covering 4 music
genres. With this dataset, we uncover that dance camera movement is
multifaceted and human-centric, and possesses multiple influencing factors,
making dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or
dance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties, we propose
DanceCamera3D, a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel
body attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation, we
devise new metrics measuring camera movement quality, diversity, and dancer
fidelity. Utilizing these metrics, we conduct extensive experiments on our DCM
dataset, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence showcasing the

single color image through coarse-to-fine mesh deformation. Although P2M is
capable of generating plausible global shapes, its Graph Convolution Network
(GCN) often produces overly smooth results, causing the loss of fine-grained
geometry details. Moreover, P2M generates non-credible features for occluded
regions and struggles with the domain gap from synthetic data to real-world
images, which is a common challenge for single-view 3D reconstruction methods.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-boosted
architecture, named T-Pixel2Mesh, inspired by the coarse-to-fine approach of
P2M. Specifically, we use a global Transformer to control the holistic shape
and a local Transformer to progressively refine the local geometry details with
graph-based point upsampling. To enhance real-world reconstruction, we present
the simple yet effective Linear Scale Search (LSS), which serves as prompt
tuning during the input preprocessing. Our experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, while results on real-world data show the
generalization capability.

                                        <span>  Detecting polyps through colonoscopy is an important task in medical image
segmentation, which provides significant assistance and reference value for
clinical surgery. However, accurate segmentation of polyps is a challenging
task due to two main reasons. Firstly, polyps exhibit various shapes and
colors. Secondly, the boundaries between polyps and their normal surroundings
are often unclear. Additionally, significant differences between different
datasets lead to limited generalization capabilities of existing methods. To
address these issues, we propose a segmentation model based on Prompt-Mamba,
which incorporates the latest Vision-Mamba and prompt technologies. Compared to
previous models trained on the same dataset, our model not only maintains high
segmentation accuracy on the validation part of the same dataset but also
demonstrates superior accuracy on unseen datasets, exhibiting excellent
generalization capabilities. Notably, we are the first to apply the
Vision-Mamba architecture to polyp segmentation and the first to utilize prompt
technology in a polyp segmentation model. Our model efficiently accomplishes
segmentation tasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by an average
of 5% across six datasets. Furthermore, we have developed multiple versions of
our model with scaled parameter counts, achieving better performance than
previous models even with fewer parameters. Our code and trained weights will
be released soon.

                                        <span>  Multi-modal emotion recognition has recently gained a lot of attention since
it can leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. Most state-of-the-art methods for
multimodal fusion rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention
mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature of the
modalities. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on
the fusion of facial, vocal, and text modalities extracted from videos.
Specifically, we propose a recursive cross-modal attention (RCMA) to
effectively capture the complementary relationships across the modalities in a
recursive fashion. The proposed model is able to effectively capture the
inter-modal relationships by computing the cross-attention weights across the
individual modalities and the joint representation of the other two modalities.
To further improve the inter-modal relationships, the obtained attended
features of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the cross-modal
attention to refine the feature representations of the individual modalities.
In addition to that, we have used Temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to
capture the temporal modeling (intra-modal relationships) of the individual
modalities. By deploying the TCNs as well cross-modal attention in a recursive
fashion, we are able to effectively capture both intra- and inter-modal
relationships across the audio, visual, and text modalities. Experimental
results on validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our
proposed fusion model is able to achieve significant improvement over the
baseline for the sixth challenge of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild
2024 (ABAW6) competition.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in non-invasive detection of cardiac hemodynamic
instability (CHDI) primarily focus on applying machine learning techniques to a
single data modality, e.g. cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite
their potential, these approaches often fall short especially when the size of
labeled patient data is limited, a common challenge in the medical domain.
Furthermore, only a few studies have explored multimodal methods to study CHDI,
which mostly rely on costly modalities such as cardiac MRI and echocardiogram.
In response to these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal variational
autoencoder ($\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$) to integrate low-cost chest X-ray
(CXR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) modalities with pre-training on a large
unlabeled dataset. Specifically, $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ introduces a
novel tri-stream pre-training strategy to learn both shared and
modality-specific features, thus enabling fine-tuning with both unimodal and
multimodal datasets. We pre-train $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ on a large,
unlabeled dataset of $50,982$ subjects from a subset of MIMIC database and then
fine-tune the pre-trained model on a labeled dataset of $795$ subjects from the
ASPIRE registry. Comprehensive evaluations against existing methods show that
$\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ offers promising performance (AUROC $=0.79$ and
Accuracy $=0.77$), representing a significant step forward in non-invasive
prediction of CHDI. Our model also excels in producing fine interpretations of
predictions directly associated with clinical features, thereby supporting
clinical decision-making.

improvements for the personalised saliency prediction task. However, prior
works require explicit user characteristics and preferences as input, which are
often difficult to obtain. We present a novel method to extract user embeddings
from pairs of natural images and corresponding saliency maps generated from a
small amount of user-specific eye tracking data. At the core of our method is a
Siamese convolutional neural encoder that learns the user embeddings by
contrasting the image and personal saliency map pairs of different users.
Evaluations on two public saliency datasets show that the generated embeddings
have high discriminative power, are effective at refining universal saliency
maps to the individual users, and generalise well across users and images.
Finally, based on our model's ability to encode individual user
characteristics, our work points towards other applications that can benefit
from reusable embeddings of gaze behaviour.

others, yet domain shift often degrades the models' performance, which can be
critical in real-world scenarios where no target images are available. This
paper proposes a zero-shot domain adaptation method based on diffusion models,
called ZoDi, which is two-fold by the design: zero-shot image transfer and
model adaptation. First, we utilize an off-the-shelf diffusion model to
synthesize target-like images by transferring the domain of source images to
the target domain. In this we specifically try to maintain the layout and
content by utilising layout-to-image diffusion models with stochastic
inversion. Secondly, we train the model using both source images and
synthesized images with the original segmentation maps while maximizing the
feature similarity of images from the two domains to learn domain-robust
representations. Through experiments we show benefits of ZoDi in the task of
image segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. It is also more applicable
than existing CLIP-based methods because it assumes no specific backbone or
models, and it enables to estimate the model's performance without target
images by inspecting generated images. Our implementation will be publicly
available.

arbitrary classes given a few support images annotated with keypoints. Existing
methods only rely on the features extracted at support keypoints to predict or
refine the keypoints on query image, but a few support feature vectors are
local and inadequate for CAPE. Considering that human can quickly perceive
potential keypoints of arbitrary objects, we propose a novel framework for CAPE
based on such potential keypoints (named as meta-points). Specifically, we
maintain learnable embeddings to capture inherent information of various
keypoints, which interact with image feature maps to produce meta-points
without any support. The produced meta-points could serve as meaningful
potential keypoints for CAPE. Due to the inevitable gap between inherency and
annotation, we finally utilize the identities and details offered by support
keypoints to assign and refine meta-points to desired keypoints in query image.
In addition, we propose a progressive deformable point decoder and a slacked
regression loss for better prediction and supervision. Our novel framework not
only reveals the inherency of keypoints but also outperforms existing methods
of CAPE. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformers (ViTs) as the base
modules have been very widely developed and applied. However, CNNs are often
limited in their ability to deal with long sequences of information, while the
low sensitivity of ViTs to local feature information and the problem of
secondary computational complexity limit their development. Recently, the
emergence of state-space models (SSMs), especially 2D-selective-scan (SS2D),
has had an impact on the longtime dominance of traditional CNNs and ViTs as the
foundational modules of visual neural networks. In this paper, we extend the
adaptability of SS2D by proposing a High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) for
medical image segmentation. Among them, the proposed High-order
2D-selective-scan (H-SS2D) progressively reduces the introduction of redundant
information during SS2D operations through higher-order interactions. In
addition, the proposed Local-SS2D module improves the learning ability of local
features of SS2D at each order of interaction. We conducted comparison and
ablation experiments on three publicly available medical image datasets
(ISIC2017, Spleen, and CVC-ClinicDB), and the results all demonstrate the
strong competitiveness of H-vmunet in medical image segmentation tasks. The

and have rich applications. However, the inherent attention mechanism in its
Transformer structure requires quadratic complexity and results in expensive
computational overhead. Therefore, in this work, we propose VL-Mamba, a
multimodal large language model based on state space models, which have been
shown to have great potential for long-sequence modeling with fast inference
and linear scaling in sequence length. Specifically, we first replace the
transformer-based backbone language model such as LLama or Vicuna with the
pre-trained Mamba language model. Then, we empirically explore how to
effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal
learning and the combinations of different vision encoders and variants of
pretrained Mamba language models. The extensive experiments on diverse
multimodal benchmarks with competitive performance show the effectiveness of
our proposed VL-Mamba and demonstrate the great potential of applying state
space models for multimodal learning tasks.

                                        <span>  When an image generation process is guided by both a text prompt and spatial
cues, such as a set of bounding boxes, do these elements work in harmony, or
does one dominate the other? Our analysis of a pretrained image diffusion model
that integrates gated self-attention into the U-Net reveals that spatial
grounding often outweighs textual grounding due to the sequential flow from
gated self-attention to cross-attention. We demonstrate that such bias can be
significantly mitigated without sacrificing accuracy in either grounding by
simply rewiring the network architecture, changing from sequential to parallel
for gated self-attention and cross-attention. This surprisingly simple yet
effective solution does not require any fine-tuning of the network but
significantly reduces the trade-off between the two groundings. Our experiments
demonstrate significant improvements from the original GLIGEN to the rewired
version in the trade-off between textual grounding and spatial grounding.

reconstructing monocular videos guided by 3DMM, we employ pseudo multi-view
videos to learn a 4D head synthesizer in a data-driven manner, avoiding
reliance on inaccurate 3DMM reconstruction that could be detrimental to the
synthesis performance. The key idea is to first learn a 3D head synthesizer
using synthetic multi-view images to convert monocular real videos into
multi-view ones, and then utilize the pseudo multi-view videos to learn a 4D
head synthesizer via cross-view self-reenactment. By leveraging a simple vision
transformer backbone with motion-aware cross-attentions, our method exhibits
superior performance compared to previous methods in terms of reconstruction
fidelity, geometry consistency, and motion control accuracy. We hope our method
offers novel insights into integrating 3D priors with 2D supervisions for
improved 4D head avatar creation.

                                        <span>  In this work, we tackle the limitations of current LiDAR-based 3D object
detection systems, which are hindered by a restricted class vocabulary and the
high costs associated with annotating new object classes. Our exploration of
open-vocabulary (OV) learning in urban environments aims to capture novel
instances using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with multi-sensor
data. We design and benchmark a set of four potential solutions as baselines,
categorizing them into either top-down or bottom-up approaches based on their
input data strategies. While effective, these methods exhibit certain
limitations, such as missing novel objects in 3D box estimation or applying
rigorous priors, leading to biases towards objects near the camera or of
rectangular geometries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a universal
\textsc{Find n' Propagate} approach for 3D OV tasks, aimed at maximizing the
recall of novel objects and propagating this detection capability to more
distant areas thereby progressively capturing more. In particular, we utilize a
greedy box seeker to search against 3D novel boxes of varying orientations and
depth in each generated frustum and ensure the reliability of newly identified
boxes by cross alignment and density ranker. Additionally, the inherent bias
towards camera-proximal objects is alleviated by the proposed remote simulator,
which randomly diversifies pseudo-labeled novel instances in the self-training
process, combined with the fusion of base samples in the memory bank. Extensive
experiments demonstrate a 53% improvement in novel recall across diverse OV
settings, VLMs, and 3D detectors. Notably, we achieve up to a 3.97-fold
increase in Average Precision (AP) for novel object classes. The source code is

                                        <span>  StyleGAN has shown remarkable performance in unconditional image generation.
However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge for
practical applications. Although recent efforts have been made to compress
StyleGAN while preserving its performance, existing compressed models still lag
behind the original model, particularly in terms of sample diversity. To
overcome this, we propose a novel channel pruning method that leverages varying
sensitivities of channels to latent vectors, which is a key factor in sample
diversity. Specifically, by assessing channel importance based on their
sensitivities to latent vector perturbations, our method enhances the diversity
of samples in the compressed model. Since our method solely focuses on the
channel pruning stage, it has complementary benefits with prior training
schemes without additional training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances sample diversity across various
datasets. Moreover, in terms of FID scores, our method not only surpasses
state-of-the-art by a large margin but also achieves comparable scores with
only half training iterations.

prediction. The next day fire prediction task consists in learning models that
receive as input the available information for an area up until a certain day,
in order to predict the occurrence of fire for the next day. Starting from our
previous problem formulation as a binary classification task on instances
(daily snapshots of each area) represented by tabular feature vectors, we
reformulate the problem as a semantic segmentation task on images; there, each
pixel corresponds to a daily snapshot of an area, while its channels represent
the formerly tabular training features. We demonstrate that this problem
formulation, built within a thorough pipeline achieves state of the art
results.

                                        <span>  ORCA (Shen et al., 2023) is a recent technique for cross-modal fine-tuning,
i.e., applying pre-trained transformer models to modalities beyond their
training data. The technique consists primarily of training an embedder and
fine-tuning the embedder and model. Despite its high performance on a variety
of downstream tasks, we do not understand precisely how each of these
components contribute to ORCA's success. Therefore, we run a series of
ablations and find that embedder training does not help 2D tasks at all,
contrary to what the original paper posits. In 1D tasks, some amount of
embedder training is necessary but more is not better. In 4 out of 6 datasets
we experiment with, it is model fine-tuning that makes the biggest difference.
Through our ablations and baselines, we contribute a better understanding of
the individual components of ORCA.

emerged as a powerful and noteworthy tool, enabling users to create
high-fidelity, custom character avatars based on their specific prompts.
However, existing personalization methods face challenges, including test-time
fine-tuning, the requirement of multiple input images, low preservation of
identity, and limited diversity in generated outcomes. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce IDAdapter, a tuning-free approach that enhances the
diversity and identity preservation in personalized image generation from a
single face image. IDAdapter integrates a personalized concept into the
generation process through a combination of textual and visual injections and a
face identity loss. During the training phase, we incorporate mixed features
from multiple reference images of a specific identity to enrich
identity-related content details, guiding the model to generate images with
more diverse styles, expressions, and angles compared to previous works.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving
both diversity and identity fidelity in generated images.

producing high-quality 3D assets from a single image remains challenging. In
this paper, we present a triplane autoencoder, which encodes 3D models into a
compact triplane latent space to effectively compress both the 3D geometry and
texture information. Within the autoencoder framework, we introduce a 3D-aware
cross-attention mechanism, which utilizes low-resolution latent representations
to query features from a high-resolution 3D feature volume, thereby enhancing
the representation capacity of the latent space. Subsequently, we train a
diffusion model on this refined latent space. In contrast to solely relying on
image embedding for 3D generation, our proposed method advocates for the
simultaneous utilization of both image embedding and shape embedding as
conditions. Specifically, the shape embedding is estimated via a diffusion
prior model conditioned on the image embedding. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms, achieving superior performance while requiring less training data
and time. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality 3D assets in
merely 7 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning without available
historical data. Compared with its counterpart (replay-based CIL) that stores
historical samples, the EFCIL suffers more from forgetting issues under the
exemplar-free constraint. In this paper, inspired by the recently developed
analytic learning (AL) based CIL, we propose a representation enhanced analytic
learning (REAL) for EFCIL. The REAL constructs a dual-stream base pretraining
(DS-BPT) and a representation enhancing distillation (RED) process to enhance
the representation of the extractor. The DS-BPT pretrains model in streams of
both supervised learning and self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) for
base knowledge extraction. The RED process distills the supervised knowledge to
the SSCL pretrained backbone and facilitates a subsequent AL-basd CIL that
converts the CIL to a recursive least-square problem. Our method addresses the
issue of insufficient discriminability in representations of unseen data caused
by a frozen backbone in the existing AL-based CIL. Empirical results on various
datasets including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k, demonstrate that
our REAL outperforms the state-of-the-arts in EFCIL, and achieves comparable or
even more superior performance compared with the replay-based methods.

descriptions, where a model should explore the interactions between natural
language instructions and human body movements. While most existing works are
confined to coarse-grained motion descriptions (e.g., "A man squats."),
fine-grained ones specifying movements of relevant body parts are barely
explored. Models trained with coarse texts may not be able to learn mappings
from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives, resulting in the
failure in generating motions from unseen descriptions. In this paper, we build
a large-scale language-motion dataset with fine-grained textual descriptions,
FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with delicate prompts. Accordingly, we
design a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, which makes full use of
fine-grained textual information. Our experiments show that FineMotionDiffuse
trained on FineHumanML3D acquires good results in quantitative evaluation. We
also find this model can better generate spatially/chronologically composite
motions by learning the implicit mappings from simple descriptions to the
corresponding basic motions.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a way of enhancing the reliability of Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) in addressing hallucination effects, where models generate
incorrect or unrelated responses. Without additional instruction tuning
paradigm, we introduce Counterfactual Inception, a novel method that implants
counterfactual thoughts into LMMs using carefully chosen, misaligned
counterfactual keywords. This method is grounded in the concept of
counterfactual thinking, a cognitive process where humans consider alternative
realities and outcomes. By applying this human-like reasoning mechanism to
LMMs, we aim to reduce hallucination effects and improve the models'
trustworthiness. We also propose Dual-modality Verification Process (DVP), a
rigorous framework for selecting optimal counterfactual keywords to trigger
counterfactual thinking into LMMs, concurrently considering visual and
linguistic context. Our extensive experiments across various LMMs, including
both open-source and proprietary models, corroborate that our method
significantly mitigates hallucination phenomena across different datasets.

                                        <span>  Logit knowledge distillation attracts increasing attention due to its
practicality in recent studies. However, it often suffers inferior performance
compared to the feature knowledge distillation. In this paper, we argue that
existing logit-based methods may be sub-optimal since they only leverage the
global logit output that couples multiple semantic knowledge. This may transfer
ambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end, we
propose a simple but effective method, i.e., Scale Decoupled Distillation
(SDD), for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output
into multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for
them. This helps the student to mine and inherit fine-grained and unambiguous
logit knowledge. Moreover, the decoupled knowledge can be further divided into
consistent and complementary logit knowledge that transfers the semantic
information and sample ambiguity, respectively. By increasing the weight of
complementary parts, SDD can guide the student to focus more on ambiguous
samples, improving its discrimination ability. Extensive experiments on several
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDD for wide
teacher-student pairs, especially in the fine-grained classification task. Code

the `Domain adaptation, Explainability, Fairness in AI for Medical Image
Analysis' (DEF-AI-MIA) workshop at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
Conference (CVPR). The competition consists of two challenges. The first is to
train a classifier to detect the presence of COVID-19 from over one thousand CT
scans from the COV19-CT-DB database. The second challenge is to perform domain
adaptation by taking the dataset from Challenge 1 and adding a small number of
scans (some annotated and other not) for a different distribution. We
preprocessed the CT scans to segment the lungs, and output volumes with the
lungs individually and together. We then trained 3D ResNet and Swin Transformer
models on these inputs. We annotated the unlabeled CT scans using an ensemble
of these models and chose the high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels for
fine-tuning. This resulted in a best cross-validation mean F1 score of 93.39\%
for Challenge 1 and a mean F1 score of 92.15 for Challenge 2.

(LLMs), their adversarial threat remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we
propose the first adversarial attack tailored for video-based LLMs by crafting
flow-based multi-modal adversarial perturbations on a small fraction of frames
within a video, dubbed FMM-Attack. Extensive experiments show that our attack
can effectively induce video-based LLMs to generate incorrect answers when
videos are added with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Intriguingly,
our FMM-Attack can also induce garbling in the model output, prompting
video-based LLMs to hallucinate. Overall, our observations inspire a further
understanding of multi-modal robustness and safety-related feature alignment
across different modalities, which is of great importance for various large
multi-modal models. Our code is available at

open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with
dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static
videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text
prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic
video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this
challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where
we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve
control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We
propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients:
1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis
based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate
textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal
Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the
temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables
control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of
the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over
existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal
attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of
applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.

unprecedented levels, paving the way to novel applications in a wide variety of
areas. In computer vision, LLMs can be used to prime vision-language tasks such
image captioning and visual question answering when coupled with pre-trained
vision backbones. While different approaches have been explored to interface
LLMs with ``perceptual backbones'' that process, e.g., visual or audio data,
they are often explored for different tasks, different datasets, and using
different perceptual backbones and language models, hindering direct comparison
of the interfacing mechanisms. To remedy this lack of comparability between
methods, we present an extensive experimental evaluation of different
interfacing mechanisms, across multiple tasks (including image, video, and
audio captioning as well as visual question answering), datasets and backbones,
paying special attention to low-data settings. We find improved performance
using existing mechanisms over state-of-the-art results, and identify a new
interfacing mechanism that yields (near) optimal results across different
tasks, while obtaining a 4x reduction in training time.

                                        <span>  Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) aims to establish interaction between different
modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in
learning semantic category discrimination. Despite the remarkable performance
of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to
the well-annotated data. However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is
expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the
multimodal scenario. In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from
the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.
Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges --
enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and
\emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To
tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based
on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval. First, we propose a
semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy
labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend
different modalities and provide precise transport cost. Second, to narrow the
discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to
infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching. Both of these two components
leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate
effective cost function. The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal
retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art
approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.

                                        <span>  Deepfake detectors are typically trained on large sets of pristine and
generated images, resulting in limited generalization capacity; they excel at
identifying deepfakes created through methods encountered during training but
struggle with those generated by unknown techniques. This paper introduces a
learning approach aimed at significantly enhancing the generalization
capabilities of deepfake detectors. Our method takes inspiration from the
unique "fingerprints" that image generation processes consistently introduce
into the frequency domain. These fingerprints manifest as structured and
distinctly recognizable frequency patterns. We propose to train detectors using
only pristine images injecting in part of them crafted frequency patterns,
simulating the effects of various deepfake generation techniques without being
specific to any. These synthetic patterns are based on generic shapes, grids,
or auras. We evaluated our approach using diverse architectures across 25
different generation methods. The models trained with our approach were able to
perform state-of-the-art deepfake detection, demonstrating also superior
generalization capabilities in comparison with previous methods. Indeed, they
are untied to any specific generation technique and can effectively identify
deepfakes regardless of how they were made.

                                        <span>  Computer vision techniques play a central role in the perception stack of
autonomous vehicles. Such methods are employed to perceive the vehicle
surroundings given sensor data. 3D LiDAR sensors are commonly used to collect
sparse 3D point clouds from the scene. However, compared to human perception,
such systems struggle to deduce the unseen parts of the scene given those
sparse point clouds. In this matter, the scene completion task aims at
predicting the gaps in the LiDAR measurements to achieve a more complete scene
representation. Given the promising results of recent diffusion models as
generative models for images, we propose extending them to achieve scene
completion from a single 3D LiDAR scan. Previous works used diffusion models
over range images extracted from LiDAR data, directly applying image-based
diffusion methods. Distinctly, we propose to directly operate on the points,
reformulating the noising and denoising diffusion process such that it can
efficiently work at scene scale. Together with our approach, we propose a
regularization loss to stabilize the noise predicted during the denoising
process. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can complete the
scene given a single LiDAR scan as input, producing a scene with more details
compared to state-of-the-art scene completion methods. We believe that our
proposed diffusion process formulation can support further research in
diffusion models applied to scene-scale point cloud data.

                                        <span>  It is essential but challenging to share medical image datasets due to
privacy issues, which prohibit building foundation models and knowledge
transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset distillation method to
condense the original medical image datasets into a synthetic one that
preserves useful information for building an analysis model without accessing
the original datasets. Existing methods tackle only natural images by randomly
matching parts of the training trajectories of the model parameters trained by
the whole real datasets. However, through extensive experiments on medical
image datasets, the training process is extremely unstable and achieves
inferior distillation results. To solve these barriers, we propose to design a
novel progressive trajectory matching strategy to improve the training
stability for medical image dataset distillation. Additionally, it is observed
that improved stability prevents the synthetic dataset diversity and final
performance improvements. Therefore, we propose a dynamic overlap mitigation
module that improves the synthetic dataset diversity by dynamically eliminating
the overlap across different images and retraining parts of the synthetic
images for better convergence. Finally, we propose a new medical image dataset
distillation benchmark of various modalities and configurations to promote fair
evaluations. It is validated that our proposed method achieves 8.33%
improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average, and 11.7%
improvement when ipc=2 (i.e., image per class is 2). Codes and benchmarks will
be released.

modeling of swarm drone formations based on natural language. The algorithm
begins by enriching a provided word, to compose a text prompt that serves as
input to an iterative approach to find the formation that best matches the
provided word. The algorithm iteratively refines formations of robots to align
with the textual description, employing different steps for "exploration" and
"exploitation". Our framework is currently evaluated on simple formation
targets, limited to contour shapes. A formation is visually represented through
alpha-shape contours and the most representative color is automatically found
for the input word. To measure the similarity between the description and the
visual representation of the formation, we use CLIP [1], encoding text and
images into vectors and assessing their similarity. Subsequently, the algorithm
rearranges the formation to visually represent the word more effectively,
within the given constraints of available drones. Control actions are then
assigned to the drones, ensuring robotic behavior and collision-free movement.
Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy in accurately modeling
robot formations from natural language descriptions. The algorithm's
versatility is showcased through the execution of drone shows in photorealistic
simulation with varying shapes. We refer the reader to the supplementary video
for a visual reference of the results.

(CNN) to analyse an individual's skin type and recommend personalised skin care
products in an immersive and interactive manner. Our methodology involves
collecting data from individuals through a questionnaire and conducting skin
analysis using a provided facial image in an immersive environment. This data
is then used to train the CNN model, which recognises the skin type and
existing issues and allows the recommendation engine to suggest personalised
skin care products. We evaluate our system in terms of the accuracy of the CNN
model, which achieves an average score of 93% in correctly classifying existing
skin issues. Being integrated into an XR system, this approach has the

(MLLMs) effectively enhances performance on downstream multimodal tasks. The
prevailing MLLM paradigm, \emph{e.g.}, LLaVA, transforms visual features into
text-like tokens using a \emph{static} vision-language mapper, thereby enabling
\emph{static} LLMs to develop the capability to comprehend visual information
through visual instruction tuning. Although promising, the \emph{static} tuning
strategy~\footnote{The static tuning refers to the trained model with static
parameters.} that shares the same parameters may constrain performance across
different downstream multimodal tasks. In light of this, we introduce
HyperLLaVA, which involves adaptive tuning of the projector and LLM parameters,
in conjunction with a dynamic visual expert and language expert, respectively.
These experts are derived from HyperNetworks, which generates adaptive
parameter shifts through visual and language guidance, enabling dynamic
projector and LLM modeling in two-stage training.
  Our experiments demonstrate that our solution significantly surpasses LLaVA
on existing MLLM benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and
LLaVA-Bench. ~\footnote{Our project is available on the link

                                        <span>  Generating medical reports for X-ray images presents a significant challenge,
particularly in unpaired scenarios where access to paired image-report data for
training is unavailable. Previous works have typically learned a joint
embedding space for images and reports, necessitating a specific labeling
schema for both. We introduce an innovative approach that eliminates the need
for consistent labeling schemas, thereby enhancing data accessibility and
enabling the use of incompatible datasets. This approach is based on
cycle-consistent mapping functions that transform image embeddings into report
embeddings, coupled with report auto-encoding for medical report generation.
Our model and objectives consider intricate local details and the overarching
semantic context within images and reports. This approach facilitates the
learning of effective mapping functions, resulting in the generation of
coherent reports. It outperforms state-of-the-art results in unpaired chest
X-ray report generation, demonstrating improvements in both language and
clinical metrics.

states of surrounding obstacles, essential for robotic perception. However,
current 3D trackers face issues with accuracy and latency consistency. In this
paper, we propose Fast-Poly, a fast and effective filter-based method for 3D
MOT. Building upon our previous work Poly-MOT, Fast-Poly addresses object
rotational anisotropy in 3D space, enhances local computation densification,
and leverages parallelization technique, improving inference speed and
precision. Fast-Poly is extensively tested on two large-scale tracking
benchmarks with Python implementation. On the nuScenes dataset, Fast-Poly
achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 75.8% AMOTA among all methods
and can run at 34.2 FPS on a personal CPU. On the Waymo dataset, Fast-Poly
exhibits competitive accuracy with 63.6% MOTA and impressive inference speed
(35.5 FPS). The source code is publicly available at

requires a large and representative set of training data. Often there is not
enough real data available which additionally cannot cover the variety of
possible defects. Synthetic data generated by a synthetic visual surface
inspection environment can overcome this problem. Therefore, a digital twin of
the object is needed, whose micro-scale surface topography is modeled by
texture synthesis models. We develop stochastic texture models for sandblasted
and milled surfaces based on topography measurements of such surfaces. As the
surface patterns differ significantly, we use separate modeling approaches for
the two cases. Sandblasted surfaces are modeled by a combination of data-based
texture synthesis methods that rely entirely on the measurements. In contrast,
the model for milled surfaces is procedural and includes all process-related
parameters known from the machine settings.

Augmented Reality (AR), a critical component for seamlessly integrating virtual
objects into real-world environments. Our research primarily addresses the
difficulty of estimating 6D poses from uncontrolled RGB images, a common
scenario in AR applications, which lacks metadata such as focal length. We
propose a novel approach that strategically decomposes the estimation of z-axis
translation and focal length, leveraging the neural-render and compare strategy
inherent in the FocalPose architecture. This methodology not only streamlines
the 6D pose estimation process but also significantly enhances the accuracy of
3D object overlaying in AR settings. Our experimental results demonstrate a
marked improvement in 6D pose estimation accuracy, with promising applications
in manufacturing and robotics. Here, the precise overlay of AR visualizations
and the advancement of robotic vision systems stand to benefit substantially

enhancing various image interpretation tasks. Pretraining is an active research
topic, encompassing supervised and self-supervised learning methods to
initialize model weights effectively. However, transferring the pretrained
models to downstream tasks may encounter task discrepancy due to their
formulation of pretraining as image classification or object discrimination
tasks. In this study, we explore the Multi-Task Pretraining (MTP) paradigm for
RS foundation models to address this issue. Using a shared encoder and
task-specific decoder architecture, we conduct multi-task supervised
pretraining on the SAMRS dataset, encompassing semantic segmentation, instance
segmentation, and rotated object detection. MTP supports both convolutional
neural networks and vision transformer foundation models with over 300 million
parameters. The pretrained models are finetuned on various RS downstream tasks,
such as scene classification, horizontal and rotated object detection, semantic
segmentation, and change detection. Extensive experiments across 14 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our models over existing ones of similar size
and their competitive performance compared to larger state-of-the-art models,
thus validating the effectiveness of MTP.

boundaries in medical scans and different observer expertise and preferences
has become a major obstacle for training deep-learning based medical image
segmentation models. To address it, the common practice is to gather multiple
annotations from different experts, leading to the setting of multi-rater
medical image segmentation. Existing works aim to either merge different
annotations into the "groundtruth" that is often unattainable in numerous
medical contexts, or generate diverse results, or produce personalized results
corresponding to individual expert raters. Here, we bring up a more ambitious
goal for multi-rater medical image segmentation, i.e., obtaining both
diversified and personalized results. Specifically, we propose a two-stage
framework named D-Persona (first Diversification and then Personalization). In
Stage I, we exploit multiple given annotations to train a Probabilistic U-Net
model, with a bound-constrained loss to improve the prediction diversity. In
this way, a common latent space is constructed in Stage I, where different
latent codes denote diversified expert opinions. Then, in Stage II, we design
multiple attention-based projection heads to adaptively query the corresponding
expert prompts from the shared latent space, and then perform the personalized
medical image segmentation. We evaluated the proposed model on our in-house
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma dataset and the public lung nodule dataset (i.e.,
LIDC-IDRI). Extensive experiments demonstrated our D-Persona can provide
diversified and personalized results at the same time, achieving new SOTA
performance for multi-rater medical image segmentation. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/ycwu1997/D-Persona.

                                        <span>  3D cell tracking in a living organism has a crucial role in live cell image
analysis. Cell tracking in C. elegans has two difficulties. First, cell
migration in a consecutive frame is large since they move their head during
scanning. Second, cell detection is often inconsistent in consecutive frames
due to touching cells and low-contrast images, and these inconsistent
detections affect the tracking performance worse. In this paper, we propose a
cell tracking method to address these issues, which has two main contributions.
First, we introduce cell position heatmap-based non-rigid alignment with
test-time fine-tuning, which can warp the detected points to near the positions
at the next frame. Second, we propose a pairwise detection method, which uses
the information of detection results at the previous frame for detecting cells
at the current frame. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
each module, and the proposed method achieved the best performance in
comparison.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation. However,
when leveraging this idea for video generation, we face significant challenges
in maintaining the consistency and continuity across video frames. This is
mainly caused by the lack of an effective framework to align frames of videos
with desired temporal features while preserving consistent semantic and
stochastic features. In this work, we propose a novel Sector-Shaped Diffusion
Model (S2DM) whose sector-shaped diffusion region is formed by a set of
ray-shaped reverse diffusion processes starting at the same noise point. S2DM
can generate a group of intrinsically related data sharing the same semantic
and stochastic features while varying on temporal features with appropriate
guided conditions. We apply S2DM to video generation tasks, and explore the use
of optical flow as temporal conditions. Our experimental results show that S2DM
outperforms many existing methods in the task of video generation without any
temporal-feature modelling modules. For text-to-video generation tasks where
temporal conditions are not explicitly given, we propose a two-stage generation
strategy which can decouple the generation of temporal features from
semantic-content features. We show that, without additional training, our model
integrated with another temporal conditions generative model can still achieve
comparable performance with existing works. Our results can be viewd at

                                        <span>  Depth-based 3D hand pose estimation is an important but challenging research
task in human-machine interaction community. Recently, dense regression methods
have attracted increasing attention in 3D hand pose estimation task, which
provide a low computational burden and high accuracy regression way by densely
regressing hand joint offset maps. However, large-scale regression offset
values are often affected by noise and outliers, leading to a significant drop
in accuracy. To tackle this, we re-formulate 3D hand pose estimation as a dense
ordinal regression problem and propose a novel Dense Ordinal Regression 3D Pose
Network (DOR3D-Net). Specifically, we first decompose offset value regression
into sub-tasks of binary classifications with ordinal constraints. Then, each
binary classifier can predict the probability of a binary spatial relationship
relative to joint, which is easier to train and yield much lower level of
noise. The estimated hand joint positions are inferred by aggregating the
ordinal regression results at local positions with a weighted sum. Furthermore,
both joint regression loss and ordinal regression loss are used to train our
DOR3D-Net in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on public datasets
(ICVL, MSRA, NYU and HANDS2017) show that our design provides significant
improvements over SOTA methods.

of place recognition, hindering the performance of Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) systems. This paper presents a novel model, called UMF
(standing for Unifying Local and Global Multimodal Features) that 1) leverages
multi-modality by cross-attention blocks between vision and LiDAR features, and
2) includes a re-ranking stage that re-orders based on local feature matching
the top-k candidates retrieved using a global representation. Our experiments,
particularly on sequences captured on a planetary-analogous environment, show
that UMF outperforms significantly previous baselines in those challenging
aliased environments. Since our work aims to enhance the reliability of SLAM in
all situations, we also explore its performance on the widely used RobotCar
dataset, for broader applicability. Code and models are available at

employ the three-step splitting operator method for solving, and the
effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on various images.

                                        <span>  Semantic image synthesis aims to generate high-quality images given semantic
conditions, i.e. segmentation masks and style reference images. Existing
methods widely adopt generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs take all
conditional inputs and directly synthesize images in a single forward step. In
this paper, semantic image synthesis is treated as an image denoising task and
is handled with a novel image-to-image diffusion model (IIDM). Specifically,
the style reference is first contaminated with random noise and then
progressively denoised by IIDM, guided by segmentation masks. Moreover, three
techniques, refinement, color-transfer and model ensembles, are proposed to
further boost the generation quality. They are plug-in inference modules and do
not require additional training. Extensive experiments show that our IIDM
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by clear margins. Further
analysis is provided via detailed demonstrations. We have implemented IIDM
based on the Jittor framework; code is available at

conflicting correlations. For correlating organoid images, we adopt and compare
two alternatives, a partial quadratic assignment problem and a twin network.
For clustering organoid images, we employ the correlation clustering problem.
Empirically, we learn the parameters of these models, infer a clustering of
organoid images, and quantify the accuracy of the inferred clusters, with
respect to a training set and a test set we contribute of state-of-the-art
light microscopy images of organoids clustered manually by biologists.

                                        <span>  Few-shot object detection (FSOD) has garnered significant research attention
in the field of remote sensing due to its ability to reduce the dependency on
large amounts of annotated data. However, two challenges persist in this area:
(1) axis-aligned proposals, which can result in misalignment for arbitrarily
oriented objects, and (2) the scarcity of annotated data still limits the
performance for unseen object categories. To address these issues, we propose a
novel FSOD method for remote sensing images called Few-shot Oriented object
detection with Memorable Contrastive learning (FOMC). Specifically, we employ
oriented bounding boxes instead of traditional horizontal bounding boxes to
learn a better feature representation for arbitrary-oriented aerial objects,
leading to enhanced detection performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to address oriented object detection in the few-shot setting for
remote sensing images. To address the challenging issue of object
misclassification, we introduce a supervised contrastive learning module with a
dynamically updated memory bank. This module enables the use of large batches
of negative samples and enhances the model's capability to learn discriminative
features for unseen classes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the DOTA
and HRSC2016 datasets, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the few-shot oriented object detection task. Code and pretrained models will be
released.

(MIL) called Learning from the Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag's label. LML aims to classify
instances using bag-level majority classes. This problem is valuable in various
applications. Existing MIL methods are unsuitable for LML due to aggregating
confidences, which may lead to inconsistency between the bag-level label and
the label obtained by counting the number of instances for each class. This may
lead to incorrect instance-level classification. We propose a counting network
trained to produce the bag-level majority labels estimated by counting the
number of instances for each class. This led to the consistency of the majority
class between the network outputs and one obtained by counting the number of
instances. Experimental results show that our counting network outperforms
conventional MIL methods on four datasets The code is publicly available at

                                        <span>  Robotic manipulation in everyday scenarios, especially in unstructured
environments, requires skills in pose-aware object manipulation (POM), which
adapts robots' grasping and handling according to an object's 6D pose.
Recognizing an object's position and orientation is crucial for effective
manipulation. For example, if a mug is lying on its side, it's more effective
to grasp it by the rim rather than the handle. Despite its importance, research
in POM skills remains limited, because learning manipulation skills requires
pose-varying simulation environments and datasets. This paper introduces
ManiPose, a pioneering benchmark designed to advance the study of pose-varying
manipulation tasks. ManiPose encompasses: 1) Simulation environments for POM
feature tasks ranging from 6D pose-specific pick-and-place of single objects to
cluttered scenes, further including interactions with articulated objects. 2) A
comprehensive dataset featuring geometrically consistent and
manipulation-oriented 6D pose labels for 2936 real-world scanned rigid objects
and 100 articulated objects across 59 categories. 3) A baseline for POM,
leveraging the inferencing abilities of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to analyze the
relationship between 6D pose and task-specific requirements, offers enhanced
pose-aware grasp prediction and motion planning capabilities. Our benchmark
demonstrates notable advancements in pose estimation, pose-aware manipulation,
and real-robot skill transfer, setting new standards for POM research. We will
open-source the ManiPose benchmark with the final version paper, inviting the
community to engage with our resources, available at our

AGFSync utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLM) to assess image quality across
style, coherence, and aesthetics, generating feedback data within an AI-driven

SDXL, our extensive experiments on the TIFA dataset demonstrate notable

benchmark, consistently outperforming the base models. AGFSync's method of

                                        <span>  Redundancy is a persistent challenge in Capsule Networks (CapsNet),leading to
high computational costs and parameter counts. Although previous works have
introduced pruning after the initial capsule layer, dynamic routing's fully
connected nature and non-orthogonal weight matrices reintroduce redundancy in
deeper layers. Besides, dynamic routing requires iterating to converge, further
increasing computational demands. In this paper, we propose an Orthogonal
Capsule Network (OrthCaps) to reduce redundancy, improve routing performance
and decrease parameter counts. Firstly, an efficient pruned capsule layer is
introduced to discard redundant capsules. Secondly, dynamic routing is replaced
with orthogonal sparse attention routing, eliminating the need for iterations
and fully connected structures. Lastly, weight matrices during routing are
orthogonalized to sustain low capsule similarity, which is the first approach
to introduce orthogonality into CapsNet as far as we know. Our experiments on
baseline datasets affirm the efficiency and robustness of OrthCaps in
classification tasks, in which ablation studies validate the criticality of
each component. Remarkably, OrthCaps-Shallow outperforms other Capsule Network
benchmarks on four datasets, utilizing only 110k parameters, which is a mere
1.25% of a standard Capsule Network's total. To the best of our knowledge, it
achieves the smallest parameter count among existing Capsule Networks.
Similarly, OrthCaps-Deep demonstrates competitive performance across four
datasets, utilizing only 1.2% of the parameters required by its counterparts.

                                        <span>  Unified anomaly detection (AD) is one of the most challenges for anomaly
detection, where one unified model is trained with normal samples from multiple
classes with the objective to detect anomalies in these classes. For such a
challenging task, popular normalizing flow (NF) based AD methods may fall into
a "homogeneous mapping" issue,where the NF-based AD models are biased to
generate similar latent representations for both normal and abnormal features,
and thereby lead to a high missing rate of anomalies. In this paper, we propose
a novel Hierarchical Gaussian mixture normalizing flow modeling method for
accomplishing unified Anomaly Detection, which we call HGAD. Our HGAD consists
of two key components: inter-class Gaussian mixture modeling and intra-class
mixed class centers learning. Compared to the previous NF-based AD methods, the
hierarchical Gaussian mixture modeling approach can bring stronger
representation capability to the latent space of normalizing flows, so that
even complex multi-class distribution can be well represented and learned in
the latent space. In this way, we can avoid mapping different class
distributions into the same single Gaussian prior, thus effectively avoiding or
mitigating the "homogeneous mapping" issue. We further indicate that the more
distinguishable different class centers, the more conducive to avoiding the
bias issue. Thus, we further propose a mutual information maximization loss for
better structuring the latent feature space. We evaluate our method on four
real-world AD benchmarks, where we can significantly improve the previous
NF-based AD methods and also outperform the SOTA unified AD methods.

                                        <span>  Video Transformers have become the prevalent solution for various video
downstream tasks with superior expressive power and flexibility. However, these
video transformers suffer from heavy computational costs induced by the massive
number of tokens across the entire video frames, which has been the major
barrier to training the model. Further, the patches irrelevant to the main
contents, e.g., backgrounds, degrade the generalization performance of models.
To tackle these issues, we propose training free token merging for lightweight
video Transformer (vid-TLDR) that aims to enhance the efficiency of video
Transformers by merging the background tokens without additional training. For
vid-TLDR, we introduce a novel approach to capture the salient regions in
videos only with the attention map. Further, we introduce the saliency-aware
token merging strategy by dropping the background tokens and sharpening the
object scores. Our experiments show that vid-TLDR significantly mitigates the
computational complexity of video Transformers while achieving competitive
performance compared to the base model without vid-TLDR. Code is available at

                                        <span>  With the emergence of vision language models in the medical imaging domain,
numerous studies have focused on two dominant research activities: (1) report
generation from Chest X-rays (CXR), and (2) synthetic scan generation from text
or reports. Despite some research incorporating multi-view CXRs into the
generative process, prior patient scans and reports have been generally
disregarded. This can inadvertently lead to the leaving out of important
medical information, thus affecting generation quality. To address this, we
propose TiBiX: Leveraging Temporal information for Bidirectional X-ray and
Report Generation. Considering previous scans, our approach facilitates
bidirectional generation, primarily addressing two challenging problems: (1)
generating the current image from the previous image and current report and (2)
generating the current report based on both the previous and current images.
Moreover, we extract and release a curated temporal benchmark dataset derived
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, which focuses on temporal data. Our comprehensive
experiments and ablation studies explore the merits of incorporating prior CXRs
and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the report generation task.
Furthermore, we attain on-par performance with SOTA image generation efforts,
thus serving as a new baseline in longitudinal bidirectional CXR-to-report
generation. The code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/TiBiX.

learning from broader datasets like ImageNet or pre-trained models like CLIP.
Model soups averages multiple fine-tuned models aiming to improve performance
on In-Domain (ID) tasks and enhance robustness against Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) datasets. However, applying these methods to the medical imaging domain
faces challenges and results in suboptimal performance. This is primarily due
to differences in error surface characteristics that stem from data
complexities such as heterogeneity, domain shift, class imbalance, and
distributional shifts between training and testing phases. To address this
issue, we propose a hierarchical merging approach that involves local and
global aggregation of models at various levels based on models' hyperparameter
configurations. Furthermore, to alleviate the need for training a large number
of models in the hyperparameter search, we introduce a computationally
efficient method using a cyclical learning rate scheduler to produce multiple
models for aggregation in the weight space. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements over the model souping approach across multiple datasets (around
6% gain in HAM10000 and CheXpert datasets) while maintaining low computational
costs for model generation and selection. Moreover, we achieve better results
on OOD datasets than model soups. The code is available at

its progression but remains challenging due to subtle cognitive impairments and
structural brain changes. Traditional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(T1-MRI) research focus on identifying brain atrophy regions but often fails to
address the intricate connectivity between them. This limitation underscores
the necessity of focuing on inter-regional connectivity for a comprehensive
understand of the brain's complex network. Moreover, there is a pressing demand
for methods that adaptively preserve and extract critical information,
particularly specialized subgraph mining techniques for brain networks. These
are essential for developing high-quality feature representations that reveal
critical spatial impacts of structural brain changes and its topology. In this
paper, we propose Brain-SubGNN, a novel graph representation network to mine
and enhance critical subgraphs based on T1-MRI. This network provides a
subgraph-level interpretation, enhancing interpretability and insights for
graph analysis. The process begins by extracting node features and a
correlation matrix between nodes to construct a task-oriented brain network.
Brain-SubGNN then adaptively identifies and enhances critical subgraphs,
capturing both loop and neighbor subgraphs. This method reflects the loop
topology and local changes, indicative of long-range connections, and maintains
local and global brain attributes. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and advantages of Brain-SubGNN, demonstrating its potential as a
powerful tool for understanding and diagnosing early-stage dementia. Source

synthesis from input views with the same brightness level captured under fixed
normal lighting. Unfortunately, synthesizing novel views remains to be a
challenge for input views with heterogeneous brightness level captured under
low-light condition. The condition is pretty common in the real world. It
causes low-contrast images where details are concealed in the darkness and
camera sensor noise significantly degrades the image quality. To tackle this
problem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise
from input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across
heterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels
across multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map
individually for each view. To allow intuitive editing of the illumination, we
design an illumination adjustment module to enable either brightening or
darkening of the illumination component. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that this approach enables effective intrinsic decomposition for low-light
multi-view noisy images and achieves superior visual quality and numerical
performance for synthesizing novel views compared to state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  As an essential task in autonomous driving (AD), motion prediction aims to
predict the future states of surround objects for navigation. One natural
solution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner
where each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and
previously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering
works like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.
However, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps
are independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single
linear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They
dominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training
MLPs compared to autoregressive networks.
  In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion
forecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a
unified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.
However, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units
-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal
and semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized
attention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and
different position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding
the transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while
adopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the
aforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets. Notably,
AMP outperforms other recent autoregressive motion prediction methods: MotionLM
and StateTransformer, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
designs.

scene text recognition. However, many existing methods emphasize performance
over efficiency and ignore the practical need for lightweight solutions in
deployment scenarios. Faced with the issues, our work proposes an efficient
framework called SGENet to facilitate deployment on resource-limited platforms.
SGENet contains two branches: super-resolution branch and semantic guidance
branch. We apply a lightweight pre-trained recognizer as a semantic extractor
to enhance the understanding of text information. Meanwhile, we design the
visual-semantic alignment module to achieve bidirectional alignment between
image features and semantics, resulting in the generation of highquality prior
guidance. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark dataset, and the
proposed SGENet achieves excellent performance with fewer computational costs.

Splatting (3DGS) typically require steady, high-quality photographs, often
impractical to capture with handheld cameras. We present a method that adapts
to camera motion and allows high-quality scene reconstruction with handheld
video data suffering from motion blur and rolling shutter distortion. Our
approach is based on detailed modelling of the physical image formation process
and utilizes velocities estimated using visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Camera
poses are considered non-static during the exposure time of a single image
frame and camera poses are further optimized in the reconstruction process. We
formulate a differentiable rendering pipeline that leverages screen space
approximation to efficiently incorporate rolling-shutter and motion blur
effects into the 3DGS framework. Our results with both synthetic and real data
demonstrate superior performance in mitigating camera motion over existing
methods, thereby advancing 3DGS in naturalistic settings.

                                        <span>  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task to ensure the
reliability and security of machine learning models deployed in real-world
applications. Conventional methods for OOD detection that rely on single-modal
information, often struggle to capture the rich variety of OOD instances. The
primary difficulty in OOD detection arises when an input image has numerous
similarities to a particular class in the in-distribution (ID) dataset, e.g.,
wolf to dog, causing the model to misclassify it. Nevertheless, it may be easy
to distinguish these classes in the semantic domain. To this end, in this
paper, a novel method called ODPC is proposed, in which specific prompts to
generate OOD peer classes of ID semantics are designed by a large language
model as an auxiliary modality to facilitate detection. Moreover, a contrastive
loss based on OOD peer classes is devised to learn compact representations of
ID classes and improve the clarity of boundaries between different classes. The
extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the method we
propose can yield state-of-the-art results.

into significantly smaller counterparts, while preserving formidable training
performance. Significant efforts have been devoted to promote evaluation
accuracy under limited compression ratio while overlooked the robustness of
distilled dataset. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that,
to the best of our knowledge, is the most extensive to date for evaluating the
adversarial robustness of distilled datasets in a unified way. Our benchmark
significantly expands upon prior efforts by incorporating a wider range of
dataset distillation methods, including the latest advancements such as TESLA
and SRe2L, a diverse array of adversarial attack methods, and evaluations
across a broader and more extensive collection of datasets such as ImageNet-1K.
Moreover, we assessed the robustness of these distilled datasets against
representative adversarial attack algorithms like PGD and AutoAttack, while
exploring their resilience from a frequency perspective. We also discovered
that incorporating distilled data into the training batches of the original
dataset can yield to improvement of robustness.

the tabular data obtained by the patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. The integrative analysis of multiple
sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of a patient's condition and
can enhance diagnoses and treatment decisions. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
consistently showcase outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal
tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively
merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information
represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing
research pursuit.
  We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging
and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and
measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information
present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical
applications. We demonstrate the strength and the generality of our method on
two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely,
brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex, and multiclass Alzheimer's
Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our
framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art
MRI-tabular data fusion methods. The code, enclosed to this manuscript will be

models by integrating multimodal understanding abilities. However, it is not
clear how they can emulate the general intelligence and reasoning ability of
humans. As recognizing patterns and abstracting concepts are key to general
intelligence, we introduce PuzzleVQA, a collection of puzzles based on abstract
patterns. With this dataset, we evaluate large multimodal models with abstract
patterns based on fundamental concepts, including colors, numbers, sizes, and
shapes. Through our experiments on state-of-the-art large multimodal models, we
find that they are not able to generalize well to simple abstract patterns.
Notably, even GPT-4V cannot solve more than half of the puzzles. To diagnose
the reasoning challenges in large multimodal models, we progressively guide the
models with our ground truth reasoning explanations for visual perception,
inductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning. Our systematic analysis finds
that the main bottlenecks of GPT-4V are weaker visual perception and inductive
reasoning abilities. Through this work, we hope to shed light on the
limitations of large multimodal models and how they can better emulate human
cognitive processes in the future (Our data and code will be released publicly
at https://github.com/declare-lab/LLM-PuzzleTest).

for entertainment and robotics. In response to the limitations of existing
datasets, we introduce LaserHuman, a pioneering dataset engineered to
revolutionize Scene-Text-to-Motion research. LaserHuman stands out with its
inclusion of genuine human motions within 3D environments, unbounded free-form
natural language descriptions, a blend of indoor and outdoor scenarios, and
dynamic, ever-changing scenes. Diverse modalities of capture data and rich
annotations present great opportunities for the research of conditional motion
generation, and can also facilitate the development of real-life applications.
Moreover, to generate semantically consistent and physically plausible human
motions, we propose a multi-conditional diffusion model, which is simple but
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.

                                        <span>  Current perceptive models heavily depend on resource-intensive datasets,
prompting the need for innovative solutions. Leveraging recent advances in
diffusion models, synthetic data, by constructing image inputs from various
annotations, proves beneficial for downstream tasks. While prior methods have
separately addressed generative and perceptive models, DetDiffusion, for the
first time, harmonizes both, tackling the challenges in generating effective
data for perceptive models. To enhance image generation with perceptive models,
we introduce perception-aware loss (P.A. loss) through segmentation, improving
both quality and controllability. To boost the performance of specific
perceptive models, our method customizes data augmentation by extracting and
utilizing perception-aware attribute (P.A. Attr) during generation.
Experimental results from the object detection task highlight DetDiffusion's
superior performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in layout-guided
generation. Furthermore, image syntheses from DetDiffusion can effectively
augment training data, significantly enhancing downstream detection
performance.

RoPE on computer vision domains have been underexplored, even though RoPE
appears capable of enhancing Vision Transformer (ViT) performance in a way
similar to the language domain. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of
RoPE when applied to ViTs, utilizing practical implementations of RoPE for 2D

extrapolation performance, i.e., maintaining precision while increasing image
resolution at inference. It eventually leads to performance improvement for
ImageNet-1k, COCO detection, and ADE-20k segmentation. We believe this study
provides thorough guidelines to apply RoPE into ViT, promising improved
backbone performance with minimal extra computational overhead. Our code and

translates any text into well-structured and textured indoor scenes at a
house-scale. By prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) with designed templates,
our approach converts provided textual narratives into amodal structured
representations. These representations guarantee consistent and realistic
spatial layouts by directing the synthesis of a geometry mesh within defined
constraints. A Score Distillation Sampling process is then employed to refine
the geometry, followed by an egocentric inpainting process that adds lifelike
textures to it. AnyHome stands out with its editability, customizability,
diversity, and realism. The structured representations for scenes allow for
extensive editing at varying levels of granularity. Capable of interpreting
texts ranging from simple labels to detailed narratives, AnyHome generates
detailed geometries and textures that outperform existing methods in both
quantitative and qualitative measures.

interest in the field of generative models. In the field of text-to-image
generation (T2I), subject-driven creation has achieved great progress with the
identity controlled via reference images. However, its extension to video
generation is not well explored. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective subject identity controllable video generation framework, termed
Video Custom Diffusion (VCD). With a specified identity defined by a few
images, VCD reinforces the identity characteristics and injects frame-wise
correlation at the initialization stage for stable video outputs. To achieve
this, we propose three novel components that are essential for high-quality
identity preservation and stable video generation: 1) a noise initialization
method with 3D Gaussian Noise Prior for better inter-frame stability; 2) an ID
module based on extended Textual Inversion trained with the cropped identity to
disentangle the ID information from the background 3) Face VCD and Tiled VCD
modules to reinforce faces and upscale the video to higher resolution while
preserving the identity's features. We conducted extensive experiments to
verify that VCD is able to generate stable videos with better ID over the
baselines. Besides, with the transferability of the encoded identity in the ID
module, VCD is also working well with personalized text-to-image models
available publicly. The codes are available at

learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve
stitching several models. Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for
automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of
standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step
multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions.
Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they
invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like
JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we
introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks
involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and
image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide
automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide
a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly
executable. With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies
(multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3
types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize
takeaways from our extensive experiments. Our dataset and code are available on
HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixianma/mnms) and Github

control over complex dynamics, such as nuanced movement among multiple
interacting objects, still presents a significant hurdle for dynamic world
modeling, compounded by the necessity to manage appearance and disappearance,
drastic scale changes, and ensure consistency for instances across frames.
These challenges hinder the development of video generation that can faithfully
mimic real-world complexity, limiting utility for applications requiring
high-level realism and controllability, including advanced scene simulation and
training of perception systems. To address that, we propose TrackDiffusion, a
novel video generation framework affording fine-grained trajectory-conditioned
motion control via diffusion models, which facilitates the precise manipulation
of the object trajectories and interactions, overcoming the prevalent
limitation of scale and continuity disruptions. A pivotal component of
TrackDiffusion is the instance enhancer, which explicitly ensures inter-frame
consistency of multiple objects, a critical factor overlooked in the current
literature. Moreover, we demonstrate that generated video sequences by our
TrackDiffusion can be used as training data for visual perception models. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply video diffusion
models with tracklet conditions and demonstrate that generated frames can be
beneficial for improving the performance of object trackers.

                                        <span>  The emergence of large multimodal models has unlocked remarkable potential in
AI, particularly in pathology. However, the lack of specialized, high-quality
benchmark impeded their development and precise evaluation. To address this, we
introduce PathMMU, the largest and highest-quality expert-validated pathology
benchmark for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). It comprises 33,428 multimodal
multi-choice questions and 24,067 images from various sources, each accompanied
by an explanation for the correct answer. The construction of PathMMU harnesses
GPT-4V's advanced capabilities, utilizing over 30,000 image-caption pairs to
enrich captions and generate corresponding Q&As in a cascading process.
Significantly, to maximize PathMMU's authority, we invite seven pathologists to
scrutinize each question under strict standards in PathMMU's validation and
test sets, while simultaneously setting an expert-level performance benchmark
for PathMMU. We conduct extensive evaluations, including zero-shot assessments
of 14 open-sourced and 4 closed-sourced LMMs and their robustness to image
corruption. We also fine-tune representative LMMs to assess their adaptability
to PathMMU. The empirical findings indicate that advanced LMMs struggle with
the challenging PathMMU benchmark, with the top-performing LMM, GPT-4V,
achieving only a 49.8% zero-shot performance, significantly lower than the
71.8% demonstrated by human pathologists. After fine-tuning, significantly
smaller open-sourced LMMs can outperform GPT-4V but still fall short of the
expertise shown by pathologists. We hope that the PathMMU will offer valuable
insights and foster the development of more specialized, next-generation LMMs
for pathology.

the Jaccard index. Leveraging IoU losses as part of the loss function have
demonstrated superior performance in semantic segmentation tasks compared to
optimizing pixel-wise losses such as the cross-entropy loss alone. However, we
identify a lack of flexibility in these losses to support vital training
techniques like label smoothing, knowledge distillation, and semi-supervised
learning, mainly due to their inability to process soft labels. To address
this, we introduce Jaccard Metric Losses (JMLs), which are identical to the
soft Jaccard loss in standard settings with hard labels but are fully
compatible with soft labels. We apply JMLs to three prominent use cases of soft
labels: label smoothing, knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning,
and demonstrate their potential to enhance model accuracy and calibration. Our
experiments show consistent improvements over the cross-entropy loss across 4
semantic segmentation datasets (Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, ADE20K, DeepGlobe Land)
and 13 architectures, including classic CNNs and recent vision transformers.
Remarkably, our straightforward approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art knowledge distillation and semi-supervised learning methods.

intricate geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics in both space and
time. Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating
static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their
synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified
representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon
the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static
scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal
dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the
characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To
enhance temporally coherent and large scene representation learning with sparse
training data, we introduce a novel temporal smoothing mechanism and a
position-aware adaptive control strategy respectively. Extensive experiments on
Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses
state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis
for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying
on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation.
Moreover, PVG exhibits 900-fold acceleration in rendering over the best
alternative.

such as landslides and infrastructure damage, leading to catastrophic losses;
thus, rapid and accurate estimates are crucial for timely and effective
post-disaster responses. Interferometric Synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data
is important in providing high-resolution onsite information for rapid hazard

type of hazard and thus often suffer low accuracy due to noisy and complex

issues in real-world image Super-Resolution (SR) by accessing both the source
and target data. Considering privacy policies or transmission restrictions of
source data in practical scenarios, we propose a SOurce-free Domain Adaptation
framework for image SR (SODA-SR) to address this issue, i.e., adapt a
source-trained model to a target domain with only unlabeled target data.
SODA-SR leverages the source-trained model to generate refined pseudo-labels
for teacher-student learning. To better utilize pseudo-labels, we propose a
novel wavelet-based augmentation method, named Wavelet Augmentation Transformer
(WAT), which can be flexibly incorporated with existing networks, to implicitly
produce useful augmented data. WAT learns low-frequency information of varying
levels across diverse samples, which is aggregated efficiently via deformable
attention. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware self-training mechanism is
proposed to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels, with inaccurate predictions
being rectified by uncertainty estimation. To acquire better SR results and
avoid overfitting pseudo-labels, several regularization losses are proposed to
constrain target LR and SR images in the frequency domain. Experiments show
that without accessing source data, SODA-SR outperforms state-of-the-art UDA
methods in both synthetic$\rightarrow$real and real$\rightarrow$real adaptation
settings, and is not constrained by specific network architectures.

                                        <span>  Untrained networks inspired by deep image prior have shown promising
capabilities in recovering a high-quality image from noisy or partial
measurements, without requiring training data. Their success has been widely
attributed to the spectral bias acting as an implicit regularization induced by
suitable network architectures. However, applications of such network-based
priors often entail superfluous architectural decisions, overfitting risks, and
slow optimization, all of which hinder their practicality. In this work, we
propose efficient, architecture-agnostic methods for a more direct frequency
control over the network priors: 1) constraining the bandwidth of the
white-noise input, 2) controlling the bandwidth of the interpolation-based
upsamplers, and 3) regularizing the Lipschitz constants of the layers. We show
that even with just one extra line of code, the overfitting issues in
underperforming architectures can be alleviated such that their performance
gaps with the high-performing counterparts can be largely closed despite their
distinct configurations, mitigating the need for architecture tuning. This then
makes it possible to employ a more compact model to achieve similar or superior
performance to larger models with greater efficiency. Our regularized network
priors compare favorably with current supervised and self-supervised methods on
MRI reconstruction and image inpainting tasks, serving as a stronger zero-shot
baseline reconstructor. Our code will be made publicly available.

                                        <span>  Learning from a limited amount of data, namely Few-Shot Learning, stands out
as a challenging computer vision task. Several works exploit semantics and
design complicated semantic fusion mechanisms to compensate for rare
representative features within restricted data. However, relying on naive
semantics such as class names introduces biases due to their brevity, while
acquiring extensive semantics from external knowledge takes a huge time and
effort. This limitation severely constrains the potential of semantics in
few-shot learning. In this paper, we design an automatic way called Semantic
Evolution to generate high-quality semantics. The incorporation of high-quality
semantics alleviates the need for complex network structures and learning
algorithms used in previous works. Hence, we employ a simple two-layer network
termed Semantic Alignment Network to transform semantics and visual features
into robust class prototypes with rich discriminative features for few-shot
classification. The experimental results show our framework outperforms all
previous methods on six benchmarks, demonstrating a simple network with
high-quality semantics can beat intricate multi-modal modules on few-shot
classification tasks. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Since the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs) enhanced
by large language models (LLMs) have grown exponentially in popularity.
However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task
information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with
understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images, making VLMs
less effective in downstream vision-language tasks. In this paper, we address
the limitation above by 1) introducing vision-language Model with Multi-Modal
In-Context Learning(MMICL), a new approach to allow the VLM to deal with
multi-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augment
the in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modal
In-Context Learning (MIC) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability to
understand complex multi-modal prompts. Our experiments confirm that MMICL
achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of general
vision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME and
MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively tackles the challenge
of complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICL
ability. Furthermore, we observe that MMICL successfully alleviates language
bias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination when
faced with extensive textual context. Our code, dataset, dataset tool, and

persistent challenges in handling intricate real-world degradations. This paper
introduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that
harnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness,
generalizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically,
we develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for
holistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both
prompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image
encoder, enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover,
a plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct
encoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method, MPerceiver
is trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art
task-specific methods across most tasks. Post multitask pre-training,
MPerceiver attains a generalized representation in low-level vision, exhibiting
remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks. Extensive
experiments on 16 IR tasks underscore the superiority of MPerceiver in terms of
adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity.

research community, particularly with the emergence of Vision-Language Models.
Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are capable of performing semantic
segmentation without relying on a fixed vocabulary, and in some cases, they
operate without the need for training or fine-tuning. However, OVS methods
typically require users to specify the vocabulary based on the task or dataset
at hand. In this paper, we introduce \textit{Auto-Vocabulary Semantic
Segmentation (AVS)}, advancing open-ended image understanding by eliminating
the necessity to predefine object categories for segmentation. Our approach,
\ours, presents a framework that autonomously identifies relevant class names
using enhanced BLIP embeddings, which are utilized for segmentation afterwards.
Given that open-ended object category predictions cannot be directly compared
with a fixed ground truth, we develop a Large Language Model-based
Auto-Vocabulary Evaluator (LAVE) to efficiently evaluate the automatically
generated class names and their corresponding segments. Our method sets new
benchmarks on datasets such as PASCAL VOC and Context, ADE20K, and Cityscapes
for AVS and showcases competitive performance to OVS methods that require
specified class names.

in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in
clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences
are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent
contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models
trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage
generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a
surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based
on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral
biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In
this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS),
a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of
the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel
mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is
conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent
code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular
schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed
state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and
quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS
was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models.
To further evaluate the usage of synthesized images in clinical downstream
tasks, we tested a segmentation network using the synthesized images at
inference.

                                        <span>  The soft Dice loss (SDL) has taken a pivotal role in numerous automated
segmentation pipelines in the medical imaging community. Over the last years,
some reasons behind its superior functioning have been uncovered and further
optimizations have been explored. However, there is currently no implementation
that supports its direct utilization in scenarios involving soft labels. Hence,
a synergy between the use of SDL and research leveraging the use of soft
labels, also in the context of model calibration, is still missing. In this
work, we introduce Dice semimetric losses (DMLs), which (i) are by design
identical to SDL in a standard setting with hard labels, but (ii) can be
employed in settings with soft labels. Our experiments on the public QUBIQ,
LiTS and KiTS benchmarks confirm the potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels
(e.g. averaging, label smoothing, and knowledge distillation) over hard labels
(e.g. majority voting and random selection). As a result, we obtain superior
Dice scores and model calibration, which supports the wider adoption of DMLs in
practice. The code is available at https://github.com/zifuwanggg/JDTLosses

                                        <span>  Object detection in remote sensing images (RSIs) often suffers from several
increasing challenges, including the large variation in object scales and the
diverse-ranging context. Prior methods tried to address these challenges by
expanding the spatial receptive field of the backbone, either through
large-kernel convolution or dilated convolution. However, the former typically
introduces considerable background noise, while the latter risks generating
overly sparse feature representations. In this paper, we introduce the Poly
Kernel Inception Network (PKINet) to handle the above challenges. PKINet
employs multi-scale convolution kernels without dilation to extract object
features of varying scales and capture local context. In addition, a Context
Anchor Attention (CAA) module is introduced in parallel to capture long-range
contextual information. These two components work jointly to advance the
performance of PKINet on four challenging remote sensing detection benchmarks,
namely DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5, HRSC2016, and DIOR-R.

                                        <span>  Accurate identification and quantification of unruptured intracranial
aneurysms (UIAs) is crucial for the risk assessment and treatment of this
cerebrovascular disorder. Current 2D manual assessment on 3D magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is suboptimal and time-consuming. In addition, one major
issue in medical image segmentation is the need for large well-annotated data,
which can be expensive to obtain. Techniques that mitigate this requirement,
such as weakly supervised learning with coarse labels are highly desirable. In
the paper, we propose FocalSegNet, a novel 3D focal modulation UNet, to detect
an aneurysm and offer an initial, coarse segmentation of it from time-of-flight
MRA image patches, which is further refined with a dense conditional random
field (CRF) post-processing layer to produce a final segmentation map. We
trained and evaluated our model on a public dataset, and in terms of UIA
detection, our model showed a low false-positive rate of 0.21 and a high
sensitivity of 0.80. For voxel-wise aneurysm segmentation, we achieved a Dice
score of 0.68 and a 95% Hausdorff distance of ~0.95 mm, demonstrating its
strong performance. We evaluated our algorithms against the state-of-the-art 3D
Residual-UNet and Swin-UNETR, and illustrated the superior performance of our
proposed FocalSegNet, highlighting the advantages of employing focal modulation
for this task.

offering efficient, high-fidelity rendering and enabling precise local
manipulations. Currently, diffusion-based 2D editing models are harnessed to
modify multi-view rendered images, which then guide the editing of 3DGS models.
However, this approach faces a critical issue of multi-view inconsistency,
where the guidance images exhibit significant discrepancies across views,
leading to mode collapse and visual artifacts of 3DGS. To this end, we
introduce View-consistent Editing (VcEdit), a novel framework that seamlessly
incorporates 3DGS into image editing processes, ensuring multi-view consistency
in edited guidance images and effectively mitigating mode collapse issues.
VcEdit employs two innovative consistency modules: the Cross-attention
Consistency Module and the Editing Consistency Module, both designed to reduce
inconsistencies in edited images. By incorporating these consistency modules
into an iterative pattern, VcEdit proficiently resolves the issue of multi-view
inconsistency, facilitating high-quality 3DGS editing across a diverse range of
scenes.

                                        <span>  In Multiple Object Tracking, objects often exhibit non-linear motion of
acceleration and deceleration, with irregular direction changes.
Tacking-by-detection (TBD) trackers with Kalman Filter motion prediction work
well in pedestrian-dominant scenarios but fall short in complex situations when
multiple objects perform non-linear and diverse motion simultaneously. To
tackle the complex non-linear motion, we propose a real-time diffusion-based
MOT approach named DiffMOT. Specifically, for the motion predictor component,
we propose a novel Decoupled Diffusion-based Motion Predictor (D$^2$MP). It
models the entire distribution of various motion presented by the data as a
whole. It also predicts an individual object's motion conditioning on an
individual's historical motion information. Furthermore, it optimizes the
diffusion process with much fewer sampling steps. As a MOT tracker, the DiffMOT
is real-time at 22.7FPS, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art on
DanceTrack and SportsMOT datasets with $62.3\%$ and $76.2\%$ in HOTA metrics,
respectively. To the best of our knowledge, DiffMOT is the first to introduce a
diffusion probabilistic model into the MOT to tackle non-linear motion
prediction.

object states is a crucial yet demanding aspect of AI research, particularly
through the lens of human interaction in real-world settings. This task
involves describing complex visual environments, identifying active objects,
and interpreting their changes as conveyed through language. Traditional
methods, which isolate object captioning and state change detection, offer a
limited view of dynamic environments. Moreover, relying on a small set of
symbolic words to represent changes has restricted the expressiveness of the
language. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the Object
State Captioning and State Change Representation (OSCaR) dataset and benchmark.
OSCaR consists of 14,084 annotated video segments with nearly 1,000 unique
objects from various egocentric video collections. It sets a new testbed for
evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our experiments
demonstrate that while MLLMs show some skill, they lack a full understanding of
object state changes. The benchmark includes a fine-tuned model that, despite
initial capabilities, requires significant improvements in accuracy and
generalization ability for effective understanding of these changes. Our code
and dataset are available at https://github.com/nguyennm1024/OSCaR.

learned models can reveal sensitive information about their training data. Many
works have investigated the effect of widely adopted data augmentation and
adversarial training techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the
privacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often
measured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether
a particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to
investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the
lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading
results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks
as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem,
we deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization
degrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil several
findings about the connections between three essential properties of machine
learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial
robustness. We demonstrate that the generalization gap and privacy leakage are
less correlated than those of the previous results. Moreover, there is not
necessarily a trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy as stronger
adversarial robustness does not make the model more susceptible to privacy
attacks.

in the ABAW6 competition. We devised a comprehensive model by preprocessing
video frames and audio segments to extract visual and audio features. Through
the utilization of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules, we effectively
captured the temporal and spatial correlations between these features.
Subsequently, we employed a Transformer encoder structure to learn long-range
dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's performance and generalization
ability. Our method leverages a multimodal data fusion approach, integrating
pre-trained audio and video backbones for feature extraction, followed by
TCN-based spatiotemporal encoding and Transformer-based temporal information
capture. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving competitive performance in VA estimation on the AffWild2 dataset.

                                        <span>  Considering how to make the model accurately understand and follow natural
language instructions and perform actions consistent with world knowledge is a
key challenge in robot manipulation. This mainly includes human fuzzy
instruction reasoning and the following of physical knowledge. Therefore, the
embodied intelligence agent must have the ability to model world knowledge from
training data. However, most existing vision and language robot manipulation
methods mainly operate in less realistic simulator and language settings and
lack explicit modeling of world knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
novel and simple robot manipulation framework, called Surfer. It is based on
the world model, treats robot manipulation as a state transfer of the visual
scene, and decouples it into two parts: action and scene. Then, the
generalization ability of the model on new instructions and new scenes is
enhanced by explicit modeling of the action and scene prediction in multi-modal
information. In addition to the framework, we also built a robot manipulation
simulator that supports full physics execution based on the MuJoCo physics
engine. It can automatically generate demonstration training data and test
data, effectively reducing labor costs. To conduct a comprehensive and
systematic evaluation of the robot manipulation model in terms of language
understanding and physical execution, we also created a robotic manipulation
benchmark with progressive reasoning tasks, called SeaWave. It contains 4
levels of progressive reasoning tasks and can provide a standardized testing
platform for embedded AI agents in multi-modal environments. On average, Surfer
achieved a success rate of 54.74% on the defined four levels of manipulation
tasks, exceeding the best baseline performance of 47.64%.

                                        <span>  The deepfake threats to society and cybersecurity have provoked significant
public apprehension, driving intensified efforts within the realm of deepfake
video detection. Current video-level methods are mostly based on {3D CNNs}
resulting in high computational demands, although have achieved good
performance. This paper introduces an elegantly simple yet effective strategy
named Thumbnail Layout (TALL), which transforms a video clip into a pre-defined
layout to realize the preservation of spatial and temporal dependencies. This
transformation process involves sequentially masking frames at the same
positions within each frame. These frames are then resized into sub-frames and
reorganized into the predetermined layout, forming thumbnails. TALL is
model-agnostic and has remarkable simplicity, necessitating only minimal code
modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a graph reasoning block (GRB) and
semantic consistency (SC) loss to strengthen TALL, culminating in TALL++. GRB
enhances interactions between different semantic regions to capture
semantic-level inconsistency clues. The semantic consistency loss imposes
consistency constraints on semantic features to improve model generalization
ability. Extensive experiments on intra-dataset, cross-dataset,
diffusion-generated image detection, and deepfake generation method recognition
show that TALL++ achieves results surpassing or comparable to the
state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approaches for
various deepfake detection problems. The code is available at

Computers and Humans Apart), a type of verification to identify whether the

designed to be easily recognized by humans while being unsolvable towards
machines or robots. However, as deep learning technology progresses,
development of convolutional neural network (CNN) models that predict

investigate the flaws and vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA generating systems in
order to design more resilient CAPTCHAs. To achieve this, we created CapNet, a

with their unparalleled scaling to large datasets. In this paper, we identify
and rectify several causes for uneven and ineffective training in the popular
ADM diffusion model architecture, without altering its high-level structure.
Observing uncontrolled magnitude changes and imbalances in both the network
activations and weights over the course of training, we redesign the network
layers to preserve activation, weight, and update magnitudes on expectation. We
find that systematic application of this philosophy eliminates the observed
drifts and imbalances, resulting in considerably better networks at equal
computational complexity. Our modifications improve the previous record FID of
2.41 in ImageNet-512 synthesis to 1.81, achieved using fast deterministic
sampling.
  As an independent contribution, we present a method for setting the
exponential moving average (EMA) parameters post-hoc, i.e., after completing
the training run. This allows precise tuning of EMA length without the cost of
performing several training runs, and reveals its surprising interactions with
network architecture, training time, and guidance.

diffusion model-based style transfer methods require inference-stage
optimization (e.g. fine-tuning or textual inversion of style) which is
time-consuming, or fails to leverage the generative ability of large-scale
diffusion models. To address these issues, we introduce a novel artistic style
transfer method based on a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without any
optimization. Specifically, we manipulate the features of self-attention layers
as the way the cross-attention mechanism works; in the generation process,
substituting the key and value of content with those of style image. This
approach provides several desirable characteristics for style transfer
including 1) preservation of content by transferring similar styles into
similar image patches and 2) transfer of style based on similarity of local
texture (e.g. edge) between content and style images. Furthermore, we introduce
query preservation and attention temperature scaling to mitigate the issue of
disruption of original content, and initial latent Adaptive Instance
Normalization (AdaIN) to deal with the disharmonious color (failure to transfer
the colors of style). Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and
diffusion-based style transfer baselines.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a multi-task representation learning framework to
jointly estimate the identity, gender and age of individuals from their hand
images for the purpose of criminal investigations since the hand images are
often the only available information in cases of serious crime such as sexual
abuse. We investigate different up-to-date deep learning architectures and
compare their performance for joint estimation of identity, gender and age from
hand images of perpetrators of serious crime. To simplify the age prediction,
we create age groups for the age estimation. We make extensive evaluations and
comparisons of both convolution-based and transformer-based deep learning
architectures on a publicly available 11k hands dataset. Our experimental
analysis shows that it is possible to efficiently estimate not only identity
but also other attributes such as gender and age of suspects jointly from hand
images for criminal investigations, which is crucial in assisting international
police forces in the court to identify and convict abusers.

                                        <span>  We present a method named iComMa to address the 6D camera pose estimation
problem in computer vision. Conventional pose estimation methods typically rely
on the target's CAD model or necessitate specific network training tailored to
particular object classes. Some existing methods have achieved promising
results in mesh-free object and scene pose estimation by inverting the Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, they still struggle with adverse
initializations such as large rotations and translations. To address this
issue, we propose an efficient method for accurate camera pose estimation by
inverting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, a gradient-based
differentiable framework optimizes camera pose by minimizing the residual
between the query image and the rendered image, requiring no training. An
end-to-end matching module is designed to enhance the model's robustness
against adverse initializations, while minimizing pixel-level comparing loss
aids in precise pose estimation. Experimental results on synthetic and complex
real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
challenging conditions and the accuracy of camera pose estimation.

                                        <span>  Video Action Counting (VAC) is crucial in analyzing sports, fitness, and
everyday activities by quantifying repetitive actions in videos. However,
traditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,
such as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research
addresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called
Irregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular
repetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:
Inter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle
Consistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of
cycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval
inconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle
segments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To
encapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes
consistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss
(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence
among cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of
cycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the
RepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in
VAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional
adaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming
existing models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the
need for dataset-specific optimization. These results confirm the efficacy of
our approach in addressing irregular repetitions in videos and pave the way for
further advancements in video analysis and understanding.

facial recognition. The system will include four separate architectures: face
detection, face recognition, face spoofing, and classification of closed eyes.
In which, we consider the problem of face recognition to be the most important,
determining the true identity of the person standing in front of the screen
with absolute accuracy is what facial recognition systems need to achieve.
Along with the development of the face recognition problem, the problem of the
anti-fake face is also gradually becoming popular and equally important. Our
goal is to propose and develop two loss functions: LMCot and Double Loss. Then
apply them to the face authentication process.

Detection (MAD) using a Siamese network with a semi-hard-loss function. Intra
and cross-dataset evaluations were performed to measure synthetic image
generalisation capabilities using a cross-dataset for evaluation. Three
different pre-trained networks were used as feature extractors from traditional
MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetB0. Our results show that MAD trained
on EfficientNetB0 from FERET, FRGCv2, and FRLL can reach a lower error rate in
comparison with SOTA. Conversely, worse performances were reached when the
system was trained only with synthetic images. A mixed approach (synthetic +
digital) database may help to improve MAD and reduce the error rate. This fact
shows that we still need to keep going with our efforts to include synthetic
images in the training process.

                                        <span>  Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections
using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve
diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features
and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying
invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells
and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop
an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast
cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin
and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists'
annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural
network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue
microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients
were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived
from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth
cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice
score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial
cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring
(0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive
epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in
situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in
HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate
division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists'
annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths. The model is made
freely available in FastPathology and the code is available at

                                        <span>  While existing motion style transfer methods are effective between two
motions with identical content, their performance significantly diminishes when
transferring style between motions with different contents. This challenge lies
in the lack of clear separation between content and style of a motion. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a novel motion style transformer that
effectively disentangles style from content and generates a plausible motion
with transferred style from a source motion. Our distinctive approach to
achieving the goal of disentanglement is twofold: (1) a new architecture for
motion style transformer with `part-attentive style modulator across body
parts' and `Siamese encoders that encode style and content features
separately'; (2) style disentanglement loss. Our method outperforms existing
methods and demonstrates exceptionally high quality, particularly in motion
pairs with different contents, without the need for heuristic post-processing.

                                        <span>  Continual learning aims to enable a model to incrementally learn knowledge
from sequentially arrived data. Previous works adopt the conventional
classification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a
classifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks
or classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding
to one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters
of a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains
all historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually
required to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named
AttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.
Specifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model
CLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from
both images and text. Text consists of a category name and a fixed number of
learnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute word bank
and serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for
classification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts,
which encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively
mitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We
evaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous
state-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with
domain-shift and long-sequence learning. The results show that our method
performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. The implementation code
can be available at https://github.com/bhrqw/AttriCLIP.

depth network learn absolute scale and estimate metric road-scene depth just
from regular training data, i.e., driving videos. We refer to this training
framework as StableCamH. The key idea is to leverage cars found on the road as
sources of scale supervision but to incorporate them in the training robustly.
StableCamH detects and estimates the sizes of cars in the frame and aggregates
scale information extracted from them into a camera height estimate whose
consistency across the entire video sequence is enforced as scale supervision.
This realizes robust unsupervised training of any, otherwise scale-oblivious,
monocular depth network to become not only scale-aware but also metric-accurate
without the need for auxiliary sensors and extra supervision. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets show the effectiveness of
StableCamH and its state-of-the-art accuracy compared with related methods. We
also show that StableCamH enables training on mixed datasets of different
camera heights, which leads to larger-scale training and thus higher
generalization. Metric depth reconstruction is essential in any road-scene
visual modeling, and StableCamH democratizes its deployment by establishing the
means to train any model as a metric depth estimator.

                                        <span>  Visual Odometry (VO) is crucial for autonomous robotic navigation, especially
in GPS-denied environments like planetary terrains. To improve robustness,
recent model-based VO systems have begun combining standard and event-based
cameras. Event cameras excel in low-light and high-speed motion, while standard
cameras provide dense and easier-to-track features, even in low-textured areas.
However, the field of image- and event-based VO still predominantly relies on
model-based methods and is yet to fully integrate recent image-only
advancements leveraging end-to-end learning-based architectures. Seamlessly
integrating the two modalities remains challenging due to their different
nature, one asynchronous, the other not, limiting the potential for a more
effective image- and event-based VO. We introduce RAMP-VO, the first end-to-end
learned image- and event-based VO system. It leverages novel Recurrent,
Asynchronous, and Massively Parallel (RAMP) encoders capable of fusing
asynchronous events with image data, providing 8x faster inference and 33% more
accurate predictions than existing solutions. Despite being trained only in
simulation, RAMP-VO outperforms image- and event-based methods by 46% and 60%,
respectively, on traditional, real-world benchmarks as well as newly introduced
Apollo and Malapert landing sequences, paving the way for robust and
asynchronous VO in space.

to emergence of new application in the domain of visual surveillance, targeted
advertisement, content-based searching, and human-computer interaction etc. Out
of the various techniques in computer vision, face analysis, in particular, has
gained much attention. Several previous studies have tried to explore different
applications of facial feature processing for a variety of tasks, including age
and gender classification. However, despite several previous studies having
explored the problem, the age and gender classification of in-wild human faces
is still far from the achieving the desired levels of accuracy required for
real-world applications. This paper, therefore, attempts to bridge this gap by
proposing a hybrid model that combines self-attention and BiLSTM approaches for
age and gender classification problems. The proposed models performance is
compared with several state-of-the-art model proposed so far. An improvement of
approximately 10percent and 6percent over the state-of-the-art implementations
for age and gender classification, respectively, are noted for the proposed
model. The proposed model is thus found to achieve superior performance and is
found to provide a more generalized learning. The model can, therefore, be
applied as a core classification component in various image processing and
computer vision problems.

                                        <span>  Existing customization methods require access to multiple reference examples
to align pre-trained diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) with user-provided
concepts. This paper aims to address the challenge of DPM customization when
the only available supervision is a differentiable metric defined on the
generated contents. Since the sampling procedure of DPMs involves recursive
calls to the denoising UNet, na\"ive gradient backpropagation requires storing
the intermediate states of all iterations, resulting in extremely high memory
consumption. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method AdjointDPM,
which first generates new samples from diffusion models by solving the
corresponding probability-flow ODEs. It then uses the adjoint sensitivity
method to backpropagate the gradients of the loss to the models' parameters
(including conditioning signals, network weights, and initial noises) by
solving another augmented ODE. To reduce numerical errors in both the forward
generation and gradient backpropagation processes, we further reparameterize
the probability-flow ODE and augmented ODE as simple non-stiff ODEs using
exponential integration. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
AdjointDPM on three interesting tasks: converting visual effects into
identification text embeddings, finetuning DPMs for specific types of
stylization, and optimizing initial noise to generate adversarial samples for
security auditing.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we present KP-RED, a unified KeyPoint-driven REtrieval and
Deformation framework that takes object scans as input and jointly retrieves
and deforms the most geometrically similar CAD models from a pre-processed
database to tightly match the target. Unlike existing dense matching based
methods that typically struggle with noisy partial scans, we propose to
leverage category-consistent sparse keypoints to naturally handle both full and
partial object scans. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight retrieval
module to establish a keypoint-based embedding space, measuring the similarity
among objects by dynamically aggregating deformation-aware local-global
features around extracted keypoints. Objects that are close in the embedding
space are considered similar in geometry. Then we introduce the neural
cage-based deformation module that estimates the influence vector of each
keypoint upon cage vertices inside its local support region to control the
deformation of the retrieved shape. Extensive experiments on the synthetic
dataset PartNet and the real-world dataset Scan2CAD demonstrate that KP-RED
surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Codes and
trained models will be released in https://github.com/lolrudy/KP-RED.

                                        <span>  This study addresses the challenge of performing visual localization in
demanding conditions such as night-time scenarios, adverse weather, and
seasonal changes. While many prior studies have focused on improving
image-matching performance to facilitate reliable dense keypoint matching
between images, existing methods often heavily rely on predefined feature
points on a reconstructed 3D model. Consequently, they tend to overlook
unobserved keypoints during the matching process. Therefore, dense keypoint
matches are not fully exploited, leading to a notable reduction in accuracy,
particularly in noisy scenes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
localization method that extracts reliable semi-dense 2D-3D matching points
based on dense keypoint matches. This approach involves regressing semi-dense
2D keypoints into 3D scene coordinates using a point inference network. The
network utilizes both geometric and visual cues to effectively infer 3D
coordinates for unobserved keypoints from the observed ones. The abundance of
matching information significantly enhances the accuracy of camera pose
estimation, even in scenarios involving noisy or sparse 3D models.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
other methods in challenging scenes and achieves competitive results in
large-scale visual localization benchmarks. The code will be available.

Language Models (MLLMs). However, the creation of high-quality instruction
tuning data presents significant challenges. Prior methods that depended on
GPT-4 for data generation were not only costly but also lacked satisfactory
performance in complex tasks (i.e., grounding-based reasoning tasks). To
address these issues, we developed an innovative data generation pipeline,
Genixer, to generate various high-quality instruction tuning data, including
nine representative tasks, e.g., Common VQA, REC, REG, and PointQ.
Specifically, Genixer provides a unified solution with four key steps for
alleviating the difficulty of data generation: (i) instruction data collection,
(ii) instruction template design, (iii) empowering MLLM, and (iv) data
generation and filtering. Subsequently, the superior qualitative results of our
Genixer demonstrate that current MLLMs have a strong potential to evolve into
powerful data generators. Additionally, to validate the efficacy of generated
data quantitatively, we add the instruction tuning data produced by Genixer
into the training of two representative MLLMs and observe the consistent
improvements on various VQA tasks and multimodal benchmarks.

modal information might miss due to some factors such as thermal sensor
self-calibration and data transmission error, called modality-missing challenge
in this work. To address this challenge, we propose a novel invertible prompt
learning approach, which integrates the content-preserving prompts into a
well-trained tracking model to adapt to various modality-missing scenarios, for
robust RGBT tracking. Given one modality-missing scenario, we propose to
utilize the available modality to generate the prompt of the missing modality
to adapt to RGBT tracking model. However, the cross-modality gap between
available and missing modalities usually causes semantic distortion and
information loss in prompt generation. To handle this issue, we design the
invertible prompter by incorporating the full reconstruction of the input
available modality from the generated prompt. To provide a comprehensive
evaluation platform, we construct several high-quality benchmark datasets, in
which various modality-missing scenarios are considered to simulate real-world
challenges. Extensive experiments on three modality-missing benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves significant performance improvements compared

data, leading to the emergence of unsupervised methodologies. Among them,
leveraging self-supervised Vision Transformers for unsupervised semantic
segmentation (USS) has been making steady progress with expressive deep
features. Yet, for semantically segmenting images with complex objects, a
predominant challenge remains: the lack of explicit object-level semantic
encoding in patch-level features. This technical limitation often leads to
inadequate segmentation of complex objects with diverse structures. To address
this gap, we present a novel approach, EAGLE, which emphasizes object-centric
representation learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically,
we introduce EiCue, a spectral technique providing semantic and structural cues
through an eigenbasis derived from the semantic similarity matrix of deep image
features and color affinity from an image. Further, by incorporating our
object-centric contrastive loss with EiCue, we guide our model to learn
object-level representations with intra- and inter-image object-feature
consistency, thereby enhancing semantic accuracy. Extensive experiments on
COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and Potsdam-3 datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
USS results of EAGLE with accurate and consistent semantic segmentation across

                                        <span>  While single task image restoration (IR) has achieved significant successes,
it remains a challenging issue to train a single model which can tackle
multiple IR tasks. In this work, we investigate in-depth the multiple-in-one
(MiO) IR problem, which comprises seven popular IR tasks. We point out that MiO
IR faces two pivotal challenges: the optimization of diverse objectives and the
adaptation to multiple tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present two simple
yet effective strategies. The first strategy, referred to as sequential
learning, attempts to address how to optimize the diverse objectives, which
guides the network to incrementally learn individual IR tasks in a sequential
manner rather than mixing them together. The second strategy, i.e., prompt
learning, attempts to address how to adapt to the different IR tasks, which
assists the network to understand the specific task and improves the
generalization ability. By evaluating on 19 test sets, we demonstrate that the
sequential and prompt learning strategies can significantly enhance the MiO
performance of commonly used CNN and Transformer backbones. Our experiments
also reveal that the two strategies can supplement each other to learn better
degradation representations and enhance the model robustness. It is expected
that our proposed MiO IR formulation and strategies could facilitate the
research on how to train IR models with higher generalization capabilities.

                                        <span>  We introduce Posterior Distillation Sampling (PDS), a novel optimization
method for parametric image editing based on diffusion models. Existing
optimization-based methods, which leverage the powerful 2D prior of diffusion
models to handle various parametric images, have mainly focused on generation.
Unlike generation, editing requires a balance between conforming to the target
attribute and preserving the identity of the source content. Recent 2D image
editing methods have achieved this balance by leveraging the stochastic latent
encoded in the generative process of diffusion models. To extend the editing
capabilities of diffusion models shown in pixel space to parameter space, we
reformulate the 2D image editing method into an optimization form named PDS.
PDS matches the stochastic latents of the source and the target, enabling the
sampling of targets in diverse parameter spaces that align with a desired
attribute while maintaining the source's identity. We demonstrate that this
optimization resembles running a generative process with the target attribute,
but aligning this process with the trajectory of the source's generative
process. Extensive editing results in Neural Radiance Fields and Scalable
Vector Graphics representations demonstrate that PDS is capable of sampling
targets to fulfill the aforementioned balance across various parameter spaces.

full-body human images. Existing StyleGAN-based methods suffer from handling
the rich diversity of garments and body shapes and poses. We propose a
framework for text-guided full-body human image synthesis via an
attention-based latent code mapper, which enables more disentangled control of
StyleGAN than existing mappers. Our latent code mapper adopts an attention
mechanism that adaptively manipulates individual latent codes on different
StyleGAN layers under text guidance. In addition, we introduce feature-space
masking at inference time to avoid unwanted changes caused by text inputs. Our
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal that our method can control
generated images more faithfully to given texts than existing methods.

                                        <span>  Medical vision-language pretraining models (VLPM) have achieved remarkable
progress in fusing chest X-rays (CXR) with clinical texts, introducing
image-text data binding approaches that enable zero-shot learning and
downstream clinical tasks. However, the current landscape lacks the holistic
integration of additional medical modalities, such as electrocardiograms (ECG).
We present MEDBind (Medical Electronic patient recorD), which learns joint
embeddings across CXR, ECG, and medical text. Using text data as the central
anchor, MEDBind features tri-modality binding, delivering competitive
performance in top-K retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot benchmarks against
established VLPM, and the ability for CXR-to-ECG zero-shot classification and
retrieval. This seamless integration is achieved through combination of
contrastive loss on modality-text pairs with our proposed contrastive loss
function, Edge-Modality Contrastive Loss, fostering a cohesive embedding space
for CXR, ECG, and text. Finally, we demonstrate that MEDBind can improve
downstream tasks by directly integrating CXR and ECG embeddings into a
large-language model for multimodal prompt tuning.

representation. Our model achieves state-of-the-art generation quality and also
enables part-level shape editing and manipulation without any additional
training in conditional setup. Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in data generation as well as zero-shot completion and editing via
a guided reverse process. Recent research on 3D diffusion models has focused on
improving their generation capabilities with various data representations,
while the absence of structural information has limited their capability in
completion and editing tasks. We thus propose our novel diffusion model using a
part-level implicit representation. To effectively learn diffusion with
high-dimensional embedding vectors of parts, we propose a cascaded framework,
learning diffusion first on a low-dimensional subspace encoding extrinsic
parameters of parts and then on the other high-dimensional subspace encoding
intrinsic attributes. In the experiments, we demonstrate the outperformance of
our method compared with the previous ones both in generation and part-level
completion and manipulation tasks.

                                        <span>  Acoustic velocity vectors are important for human's localization of sound at
low frequencies. This paper proposes a sound field reproduction algorithm,
which matches the acoustic velocity vectors in a circular listening area. In
previous work, acoustic velocity vectors are matched either at sweet spots or
on the boundary of the listening area. Sweet spots restrict listener's
movement, whereas measuring the acoustic velocity vectors on the boundary
requires complicated measurement setup. This paper proposes the cylindrical
harmonic coefficients of the acoustic velocity vectors in a circular area (CHV
coefficients), which are calculated from the cylindrical harmonic coefficients
of the global pressure (global CHP coefficients) by using the sound field
translation formula. The global CHP coefficients can be measured by a circular
microphone array, which can be bought off-the-shelf. By matching the CHV
coefficients, the acoustic velocity vectors are reproduced throughout the
listening area. Hence, listener's movements are allowed. Simulations show that
at low frequency, where the acoustic velocity vectors are the dominant factor
for localization, the proposed reproduction method based on the CHV
coefficients results in higher accuracy in reproduced acoustic velocity vectors
when compared with traditional method based on the global CHP coefficients.

                                        <span>  Real-time speech extraction is an important challenge with various
applications such as speech recognition in a human-like avatar/robot. In this
paper, we propose the real-time extension of a speech extraction method based
on independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) and rank-constrained spatial
covariance matrix estimation (RCSCME). The RCSCME-based method is a
multichannel blind speech extraction method that demonstrates superior speech
extraction performance in diffuse noise environments. To improve the
performance, we introduce spatial regularization into the ILRMA part of the
RCSCME-based speech extraction and design two regularizers. Speech extraction
experiments demonstrated that the proposed methods can function in real time
and the designed regularizers improve the speech extraction performance.

                                        <span>  This paper presents our approach for the VA (Valence-Arousal) estimation task
in the ABAW6 competition. We devised a comprehensive model by preprocessing
video frames and audio segments to extract visual and audio features. Through
the utilization of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules, we effectively
captured the temporal and spatial correlations between these features.
Subsequently, we employed a Transformer encoder structure to learn long-range
dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's performance and generalization
ability. Our method leverages a multimodal data fusion approach, integrating
pre-trained audio and video backbones for feature extraction, followed by
TCN-based spatiotemporal encoding and Transformer-based temporal information
capture. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving competitive performance in VA estimation on the AffWild2 dataset.

                                        <span>  Speech language models (LMs) are promising for high-quality speech synthesis
through in-context learning. A typical speech LM takes discrete semantic units
as content and a short utterance as prompt, and synthesizes speech which
preserves the content's semantics but mimics the prompt's style. However, there
is no systematic understanding on how the synthesized audio is controlled by
the prompt and content. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the
widely used autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech LMs and
provide insights into the prompt design and content semantic units. Our
analysis reveals that heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts hurt the audio
quality in contrast to the previous finding that longer prompts always lead to
better synthesis. Moreover, we find that the speaker style of the synthesized
audio is also affected by the content in addition to the prompt. We further
show that semantic units carry rich acoustic information such as pitch, tempo,
volume and speech emphasis, which might be leaked from the content to the
synthesized audio.

                                        <span>  Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models across diverse
tasks, their complexity poses challenges for interpretation. This challenge is
particularly evident for audio signals, where conveying interpretations becomes
inherently difficult. To address this issue, we introduce Listenable Maps for
Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method that generates
faithful and listenable interpretations. L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a
pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions
of the input audio. We train the decoder with a special loss that maximizes the
confidence of the classifier decision on the masked-in portion of the audio
while minimizing the probability of model output for the masked-out portion.
Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate
that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several
gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms
that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed
technique.

                                        <span>  Asynchronous microphone array calibration is a prerequisite for most audition
robot applications. A popular solution to the above calibration problem is the
batch form of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), using the time
difference of arrival measurements between two microphones (TDOA-M), and the
robot (which serves as a moving sound source during calibration) odometry
information. In this paper, we introduce a new form of measurement for
microphone array calibration, i.e. the time difference of arrival between
adjacent sound events (TDOA-S) with respect to the microphone channels. We
propose to combine TDOA-S and TDOA-M, called hybrid TDOA, together with
odometry measurements for bath SLAM-based calibration of asynchronous
microphone arrays. Simulation and real-world experiment results consistently
show that our method is more independent of microphone number, less sensitive
to initial values (when using off-the-shelf algorithms such as Gauss-Newton
iterations), and has better calibration accuracy and robustness under various
TDOA noises. In addition, the simulation result demonstrates that our method
has a lower Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for microphone parameters. To
benefit the community, we open-source our code and data at
https://github.com/zcj808/Hybrid-TDOA-Calib.

                                        <span>  Data-driven modeling of complex physical systems is receiving a growing
amount of attention in the simulation and machine learning communities. Since
most physical simulations are based on compute-intensive, iterative
implementations of differential equation systems, a (partial) replacement with
learned, 1-step inference models has the potential for significant speedups in
a wide range of application areas. In this context, we present a novel
benchmark for the evaluation of 1-step generative learning models in terms of
speed and physical correctness. Our Urban Sound Propagation benchmark is based
on the physically complex and practically relevant, yet intuitively easy to
grasp task of modeling the 2d propagation of waves from a sound source in an
urban environment. We provide a dataset with 100k samples, where each sample
consists of pairs of real 2d building maps drawn from OpenStreetmap, a
parameterized sound source, and a simulated ground truth sound propagation for
the given scene. The dataset provides four different simulation tasks with
increasing complexity regarding reflection, diffraction and source variance. A
first baseline evaluation of common generative U-Net, GAN and Diffusion models
shows, that while these models are very well capable of modeling sound
propagations in simple cases, the approximation of sub-systems represented by
higher order equations systematically fails. Information about the dataset,
download instructions and source codes are provided on our website:

perception by utilizing correlation between auditory and visual information.
However, current models often focus on a limited set of tasks, and
generalization abilities of learned representations are unclear. To this end,
we propose the AV-SUPERB benchmark that enables general-purpose evaluation of
unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering
5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing. We evaluate 5 recent
self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all
tasks, emphasizing the need for future study on improving universal model
performance. In addition, we show that representations may be improved with
intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet
serves as a strong intermediate task. We release our benchmark with evaluation
code and a model submission platform to encourage further research in
audio-visual learning.

(EMI) Estimation challenge, which is part of 6th Affective Behavior Analysis
in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition.The EMI Estimation challenge task aims to
evaluate the emotional intensity of seed videos by assessing them from a set of
predefined emotion categories (i.e., "Admiration", "Amusement",
"Determination", "Empathic Pain", "Excitement" and "Joy"). To tackle this
challenge, we extracted rich dual-channel visual features based on ResNet18 and
AUs for the video modality and effective single-channel features based on
Wav2Vec2.0 for the audio modality. This allowed us to obtain comprehensive
emotional features for the audiovisual modality. Additionally, leveraging a
late fusion strategy, we averaged the predictions of the visual and acoustic
models, resulting in a more accurate estimation of audiovisual emotional
mimicry intensity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, with the average Pearson's correlation Coefficient($\rho$) across the
6 emotion dimensionson the validation set achieving 0.3288.

                                        <span>  Acoustic velocity vectors are important for human's localization of sound at
low frequencies. This paper proposes a sound field reproduction algorithm,
which matches the acoustic velocity vectors in a circular listening area. In
previous work, acoustic velocity vectors are matched either at sweet spots or
on the boundary of the listening area. Sweet spots restrict listener's
movement, whereas measuring the acoustic velocity vectors on the boundary
requires complicated measurement setup. This paper proposes the cylindrical
harmonic coefficients of the acoustic velocity vectors in a circular area (CHV
coefficients), which are calculated from the cylindrical harmonic coefficients
of the global pressure (global CHP coefficients) by using the sound field
translation formula. The global CHP coefficients can be measured by a circular
microphone array, which can be bought off-the-shelf. By matching the CHV
coefficients, the acoustic velocity vectors are reproduced throughout the
listening area. Hence, listener's movements are allowed. Simulations show that
at low frequency, where the acoustic velocity vectors are the dominant factor
for localization, the proposed reproduction method based on the CHV
coefficients results in higher accuracy in reproduced acoustic velocity vectors
when compared with traditional method based on the global CHP coefficients.

in the ABAW6 competition. We devised a comprehensive model by preprocessing
video frames and audio segments to extract visual and audio features. Through
the utilization of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) modules, we effectively
captured the temporal and spatial correlations between these features.
Subsequently, we employed a Transformer encoder structure to learn long-range
dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's performance and generalization
ability. Our method leverages a multimodal data fusion approach, integrating
pre-trained audio and video backbones for feature extraction, followed by
TCN-based spatiotemporal encoding and Transformer-based temporal information
capture. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving competitive performance in VA estimation on the AffWild2 dataset.

                                        <span>  Speech language models (LMs) are promising for high-quality speech synthesis
through in-context learning. A typical speech LM takes discrete semantic units
as content and a short utterance as prompt, and synthesizes speech which
preserves the content's semantics but mimics the prompt's style. However, there
is no systematic understanding on how the synthesized audio is controlled by
the prompt and content. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the
widely used autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech LMs and
provide insights into the prompt design and content semantic units. Our
analysis reveals that heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts hurt the audio
quality in contrast to the previous finding that longer prompts always lead to
better synthesis. Moreover, we find that the speaker style of the synthesized
audio is also affected by the content in addition to the prompt. We further
show that semantic units carry rich acoustic information such as pitch, tempo,
volume and speech emphasis, which might be leaked from the content to the
synthesized audio.

                                        <span>  Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models across diverse
tasks, their complexity poses challenges for interpretation. This challenge is
particularly evident for audio signals, where conveying interpretations becomes
inherently difficult. To address this issue, we introduce Listenable Maps for
Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method that generates
faithful and listenable interpretations. L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a
pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions
of the input audio. We train the decoder with a special loss that maximizes the
confidence of the classifier decision on the masked-in portion of the audio
while minimizing the probability of model output for the masked-out portion.
Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate
that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several
gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms
that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed
technique.

                                        <span>  Asynchronous microphone array calibration is a prerequisite for most audition
robot applications. A popular solution to the above calibration problem is the
batch form of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), using the time
difference of arrival measurements between two microphones (TDOA-M), and the
robot (which serves as a moving sound source during calibration) odometry
information. In this paper, we introduce a new form of measurement for
microphone array calibration, i.e. the time difference of arrival between
adjacent sound events (TDOA-S) with respect to the microphone channels. We
propose to combine TDOA-S and TDOA-M, called hybrid TDOA, together with
odometry measurements for bath SLAM-based calibration of asynchronous
microphone arrays. Simulation and real-world experiment results consistently
show that our method is more independent of microphone number, less sensitive
to initial values (when using off-the-shelf algorithms such as Gauss-Newton
iterations), and has better calibration accuracy and robustness under various
TDOA noises. In addition, the simulation result demonstrates that our method
has a lower Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for microphone parameters. To
benefit the community, we open-source our code and data at
https://github.com/zcj808/Hybrid-TDOA-Calib.

amount of attention in the simulation and machine learning communities. Since
most physical simulations are based on compute-intensive, iterative
implementations of differential equation systems, a (partial) replacement with
learned, 1-step inference models has the potential for significant speedups in
a wide range of application areas. In this context, we present a novel
benchmark for the evaluation of 1-step generative learning models in terms of
speed and physical correctness. Our Urban Sound Propagation benchmark is based
on the physically complex and practically relevant, yet intuitively easy to
grasp task of modeling the 2d propagation of waves from a sound source in an
urban environment. We provide a dataset with 100k samples, where each sample
consists of pairs of real 2d building maps drawn from OpenStreetmap, a
parameterized sound source, and a simulated ground truth sound propagation for
the given scene. The dataset provides four different simulation tasks with
increasing complexity regarding reflection, diffraction and source variance. A
first baseline evaluation of common generative U-Net, GAN and Diffusion models
shows, that while these models are very well capable of modeling sound
propagations in simple cases, the approximation of sub-systems represented by
higher order equations systematically fails. Information about the dataset,
download instructions and source codes are provided on our website:

However, current models often focus on a limited set of tasks, and
generalization abilities of learned representations are unclear. To this end,
we propose the AV-SUPERB benchmark that enables general-purpose evaluation of
unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering
5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing. We evaluate 5 recent
self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all
tasks, emphasizing the need for future study on improving universal model
performance. In addition, we show that representations may be improved with
intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet
serves as a strong intermediate task. We release our benchmark with evaluation
code and a model submission platform to encourage further research in
audio-visual learning.

(EMI) Estimation challenge, which is part of 6th Affective Behavior Analysis
in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition.The EMI Estimation challenge task aims to
evaluate the emotional intensity of seed videos by assessing them from a set of
predefined emotion categories (i.e., "Admiration", "Amusement",
"Determination", "Empathic Pain", "Excitement" and "Joy"). To tackle this
challenge, we extracted rich dual-channel visual features based on ResNet18 and
AUs for the video modality and effective single-channel features based on
Wav2Vec2.0 for the audio modality. This allowed us to obtain comprehensive
emotional features for the audiovisual modality. Additionally, leveraging a
late fusion strategy, we averaged the predictions of the visual and acoustic
models, resulting in a more accurate estimation of audiovisual emotional
mimicry intensity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, with the average Pearson's correlation Coefficient($\rho$) across the
6 emotion dimensionson the validation set achieving 0.3288.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a novel framework for virtual try-on, termed
Wear-Any-Way. Different from previous methods, Wear-Any-Way is a customizable
solution. Besides generating high-fidelity results, our method supports users
to precisely manipulate the wearing style. To achieve this goal, we first
construct a strong pipeline for standard virtual try-on, supporting
single/multiple garment try-on and model-to-model settings in complicated
scenarios. To make it manipulable, we propose sparse correspondence alignment
which involves point-based control to guide the generation for specific
locations. With this design, Wear-Any-Way gets state-of-the-art performance for
the standard setting and provides a novel interaction form for customizing the
wearing style. For instance, it supports users to drag the sleeve to make it
rolled up, drag the coat to make it open, and utilize clicks to control the
style of tuck, etc. Wear-Any-Way enables more liberated and flexible
expressions of the attires, holding profound implications in the fashion
industry.

                                        <span>  In the realm of vision-language understanding, the proficiency of models in
interpreting and reasoning over visual content has become a cornerstone for
numerous applications. However, it is challenging for the visual encoder in
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to extract useful features tailored to
questions that aid the language model's response. Furthermore, a common
practice among existing LVLMs is to utilize lower-resolution images, which
restricts the ability for visual recognition. Our work introduces the
Chain-of-Spot (CoS) method, which we describe as Interactive Reasoning, a novel
approach that enhances feature extraction by focusing on key regions of
interest (ROI) within the image, corresponding to the posed questions or
instructions. This technique allows LVLMs to access more detailed visual
information without altering the original image resolution, thereby offering
multi-granularity image features. By integrating Chain-of-Spot with
instruct-following LLaVA-1.5 models, the process of image reasoning
consistently improves performance across a wide range of multimodal datasets
and benchmarks without bells and whistles and achieves new state-of-the-art
results. Our empirical findings demonstrate a significant improvement in LVLMs'
ability to understand and reason about visual content, paving the way for more
sophisticated visual instruction-following applications. Code and models are

                                        <span>  Recently, large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated great potential in learning open-world visual representations, and
exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks through
efficient fine-tuning. In this work, we innovatively introduce the concept of
dual learning into fine-tuning VLMs, i.e., we not only learn what an image is,
but also what an image isn't. Building on this concept, we introduce a novel
DualAdapter approach to enable dual-path adaptation of VLMs from both positive
and negative perspectives with only limited annotated samples. In the inference
stage, our DualAdapter performs unified predictions by simultaneously
conducting complementary positive selection and negative exclusion across
target classes, thereby enhancing the overall recognition accuracy of VLMs in
downstream tasks. Our extensive experimental results across 15 datasets
validate that the proposed DualAdapter outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on both few-shot learning and domain generalization tasks while
achieving competitive computational efficiency. Code is available at

pre-trained diffusion models, addressing persistent challenges, such as
repetitive patterns and structural distortions, that emerge when models are

an innovative, training-free approach FouriScale from the perspective of
frequency domain analysis. We replace the original convolutional layers in
pre-trained diffusion models by incorporating a dilation technique along with a
low-pass operation, intending to achieve structural consistency and scale
consistency across resolutions, respectively. Further enhanced by a
padding-then-crop strategy, our method can flexibly handle text-to-image
generation of various aspect ratios. By using the FouriScale as guidance, our
method successfully balances the structural integrity and fidelity of generated

extensive exploration of their potential application in video domains.
Zero-shot methods seek to extend image diffusion models to videos without
necessitating model training. Recent methods mainly focus on incorporating
inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft
constraint imposed on determining where to attend to valid features can
sometimes be insufficient, resulting in temporal inconsistency. In this paper,
we introduce FRESCO, intra-frame correspondence alongside inter-frame
correspondence to establish a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This
enhancement ensures a more consistent transformation of semantically similar
content across frames. Beyond mere attention guidance, our approach involves an
explicit update of features to achieve high spatial-temporal consistency with
the input video, significantly improving the visual coherence of the resulting
translated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed framework in producing high-quality, coherent videos, marking a
notable improvement over existing zero-shot methods.

                                        <span>  We introduce TexTile, a novel differentiable metric to quantify the degree
upon which a texture image can be concatenated with itself without introducing
repeating artifacts (i.e., the tileability). Existing methods for tileable
texture synthesis focus on general texture quality, but lack explicit analysis
of the intrinsic repeatability properties of a texture. In contrast, our
TexTile metric effectively evaluates the tileable properties of a texture,
opening the door to more informed synthesis and analysis of tileable textures.
Under the hood, TexTile is formulated as a binary classifier carefully built
from a large dataset of textures of different styles, semantics, regularities,
and human annotations.Key to our method is a set of architectural modifications
to baseline pre-train image classifiers to overcome their shortcomings at
measuring tileability, along with a custom data augmentation and training
regime aimed at increasing robustness and accuracy. We demonstrate that TexTile
can be plugged into different state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods,
including diffusion-based strategies, and generate tileable textures while
keeping or even improving the overall texture quality. Furthermore, we show
that TexTile can objectively evaluate any tileable texture synthesis method,
whereas the current mix of existing metrics produces uncorrelated scores which
heavily hinders progress in the field.

                                        <span>  In this work, we introduce FaceXformer, an end-to-end unified transformer
model for a comprehensive range of facial analysis tasks such as face parsing,
landmark detection, head pose estimation, attributes recognition, and
estimation of age, gender, race, and landmarks visibility. Conventional methods
in face analysis have often relied on task-specific designs and preprocessing
techniques, which limit their approach to a unified architecture. Unlike these
conventional methods, our FaceXformer leverages a transformer-based
encoder-decoder architecture where each task is treated as a learnable token,
enabling the integration of multiple tasks within a single framework. Moreover,
we propose a parameter-efficient decoder, FaceX, which jointly processes face
and task tokens, thereby learning generalized and robust face representations
across different tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
propose a single model capable of handling all these facial analysis tasks
using transformers. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of effective
backbones for unified face task processing and evaluated different task queries
and the synergy between them. We conduct experiments against state-of-the-art
specialized models and previous multi-task models in both intra-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, our model
effectively handles images "in-the-wild," demonstrating its robustness and
generalizability across eight different tasks, all while maintaining the
real-time performance of 37 FPS.

coordinate system from a monocular video is a highly desirable yet challenging
and ill-posed problem. In this study, we aim to recover expressive parametric
human models (i.e., SMPL-X) and corresponding camera poses jointly, by
leveraging the synergy between three critical players: the world, the human,
and the camera. Our approach is founded on two key observations. Firstly,
camera-frame SMPL-X estimation methods readily recover absolute human depth.
Secondly, human motions inherently provide absolute spatial cues. By
integrating these insights, we introduce a novel framework, referred to as
WHAC, to facilitate world-grounded expressive human pose and shape estimation
(EHPS) alongside camera pose estimation, without relying on traditional
optimization techniques. Additionally, we present a new synthetic dataset,
WHAC-A-Mole, which includes accurately annotated humans and cameras, and
features diverse interactive human motions as well as realistic camera
trajectories. Extensive experiments on both standard and newly established
benchmarks highlight the superiority and efficacy of our framework. We will
make the code and dataset publicly available.

                                        <span>  In recent years, 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful technique
for 3D reconstruction and generation, known for its fast and high-quality
rendering capabilities. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a
novel diffusion-based framework, GVGEN, designed to efficiently generate 3D
Gaussian representations from text input. We propose two innovative
techniques:(1) Structured Volumetric Representation. We first arrange
disorganized 3D Gaussian points as a structured form GaussianVolume. This
transformation allows the capture of intricate texture details within a volume
composed of a fixed number of Gaussians. To better optimize the representation
of these details, we propose a unique pruning and densifying method named the
Candidate Pool Strategy, enhancing detail fidelity through selective
optimization. (2) Coarse-to-fine Generation Pipeline. To simplify the
generation of GaussianVolume and empower the model to generate instances with
detailed 3D geometry, we propose a coarse-to-fine pipeline. It initially
constructs a basic geometric structure, followed by the prediction of complete
Gaussian attributes. Our framework, GVGEN, demonstrates superior performance in
qualitative and quantitative assessments compared to existing 3D generation
methods. Simultaneously, it maintains a fast generation speed ($\sim$7
seconds), effectively striking a balance between quality and efficiency.

FutureDepth, which enables the model to implicitly leverage multi-frame and
motion cues to improve depth estimation by making it learn to predict the
future at training. More specifically, we propose a future prediction network,
F-Net, which takes the features of multiple consecutive frames and is trained
to predict multi-frame features one time step ahead iteratively. In this way,
F-Net learns the underlying motion and correspondence information, and we
incorporate its features into the depth decoding process. Additionally, to
enrich the learning of multiframe correspondence cues, we further leverage a
reconstruction network, R-Net, which is trained via adaptively masked
auto-encoding of multiframe feature volumes. At inference time, both F-Net and
R-Net are used to produce queries to work with the depth decoder, as well as a
final refinement network. Through extensive experiments on several benchmarks,
i.e., NYUDv2, KITTI, DDAD, and Sintel, which cover indoor, driving, and
open-domain scenarios, we show that FutureDepth significantly improves upon
baseline models, outperforms existing video depth estimation methods, and sets
new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy. Furthermore, FutureDepth is more
efficient than existing SOTA video depth estimation models and has similar
latencies when comparing to monocular models

computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their
promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain
shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time
Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt
VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the
notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By
pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text
encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for
subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current
advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift
vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively
bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect
of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands
when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations
across 15 datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset
generalization demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.

                                        <span>  Grape cluster architecture and compactness are complex traits influencing
disease susceptibility, fruit quality, and yield. Evaluation methods for these
traits include visual scoring, manual methodologies, and computer vision, with
the latter being the most scalable approach. Most of the existing computer
vision approaches for processing cluster images often rely on conventional
segmentation or machine learning with extensive training and limited
generalization. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a novel foundation model
trained on a massive image dataset, enables automated object segmentation
without additional training. This study demonstrates out-of-the-box SAM's high
accuracy in identifying individual berries in 2D cluster images. Using this
model, we managed to segment approximately 3,500 cluster images, generating
over 150,000 berry masks, each linked with spatial coordinates within their
clusters. The correlation between human-identified berries and SAM predictions
was very strong (Pearson r2=0.96). Although the visible berry count in images
typically underestimates the actual cluster berry count due to visibility
issues, we demonstrated that this discrepancy could be adjusted using a linear
regression model (adjusted R2=0.87). We emphasized the critical importance of
the angle at which the cluster is imaged, noting its substantial effect on
berry counts and architecture. We proposed different approaches in which berry
location information facilitated the calculation of complex features related to
cluster architecture and compactness. Finally, we discussed SAM's potential
integration into currently available pipelines for image generation and
processing in vineyard conditions.

                                        <span>  Understanding illumination and reducing the need for supervision pose a
significant challenge in low-light enhancement. Current approaches are highly
sensitive to data usage during training and illumination-specific
hyper-parameters, limiting their ability to handle unseen scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a new zero-reference low-light enhancement framework
trainable solely with normal light images. To accomplish this, we devise an
illumination-invariant prior inspired by the theory of physical light transfer.
This prior serves as the bridge between normal and low-light images. Then, we
develop a prior-to-image framework trained without low-light data. During
testing, this framework is able to restore our illumination-invariant prior
back to images, automatically achieving low-light enhancement. Within this
framework, we leverage a pretrained generative diffusion model for model
ability, introduce a bypass decoder to handle detail distortion, as well as
offer a lightweight version for practicality. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our framework's superiority in various scenarios as well as good
interpretability, robustness, and efficiency. Code is available on our project

                                        <span>  The Audio Description (AD) task aims to generate descriptions of visual
elements for visually impaired individuals to help them access long-form video
contents, like movie. With video feature, text, character bank and context
information as inputs, the generated ADs are able to correspond to the
characters by name and provide reasonable, contextual descriptions to help
audience understand the storyline of movie. To achieve this goal, we propose to
leverage pre-trained foundation models through a simple and unified framework
to generate ADs with interleaved multimodal sequence as input, termed as
Uni-AD. To enhance the alignment of features across various modalities with
finer granularity, we introduce a simple and lightweight module that maps video
features into the textual feature space. Moreover, we also propose a
character-refinement module to provide more precise information by identifying
the main characters who play more significant role in the video context. With
these unique designs, we further incorporate contextual information and a
contrastive loss into our architecture to generate more smooth and contextual
ADs. Experiments on the MAD-eval dataset show that Uni-AD can achieve
state-of-the-art performance on AD generation, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach. Code will be available at

(SeLRoS), an advanced method for semantic room segmentation by integrating
Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional 2D map-based segmentation. Unlike
previous approaches that solely focus on the geometric segmentation of indoor
environments, our work enriches segmented maps with semantic data, including
object identification and spatial relationships, to enhance robotic navigation.
By leveraging LLMs, we provide a novel framework that interprets and organizes
complex information about each segmented area, thereby improving the accuracy
and contextual relevance of room segmentation. Furthermore, SeLRoS overcomes
the limitations of existing algorithms by using a semantic evaluation method to
accurately distinguish true room divisions from those erroneously generated by
furniture and segmentation inaccuracies. The effectiveness of SeLRoS is
verified through its application across 30 different 3D environments. Source

                                        <span>  Structure information is critical for understanding the semantics of
text-rich images, such as documents, tables, and charts. Existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Visual Document Understanding are equipped
with text recognition ability but lack general structure understanding
abilities for text-rich document images. In this work, we emphasize the
importance of structure information in Visual Document Understanding and
propose the Unified Structure Learning to boost the performance of MLLMs. Our
Unified Structure Learning comprises structure-aware parsing tasks and
multi-grained text localization tasks across 5 domains: document, webpage,
table, chart, and natural image. To better encode structure information, we
design a simple and effective vision-to-text module H-Reducer, which can not
only maintain the layout information but also reduce the length of visual
features by merging horizontal adjacent patches through convolution, enabling
the LLM to understand high-resolution images more efficiently. Furthermore, by
constructing structure-aware text sequences and multi-grained pairs of texts
and bounding boxes for publicly available text-rich images, we build a
comprehensive training set DocStruct4M to support structure learning. Finally,
we construct a small but high-quality reasoning tuning dataset DocReason25K to
trigger the detailed explanation ability in the document domain. Our model
DocOwl 1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 visual document
understanding benchmarks, improving the SOTA performance of MLLMs with a 7B LLM
by more than 10 points in 5/10 benchmarks. Our codes, models, and datasets are

                                        <span>  Medical vision-language pretraining models (VLPM) have achieved remarkable
progress in fusing chest X-rays (CXR) with clinical texts, introducing
image-text data binding approaches that enable zero-shot learning and
downstream clinical tasks. However, the current landscape lacks the holistic
integration of additional medical modalities, such as electrocardiograms (ECG).
We present MEDBind (Medical Electronic patient recorD), which learns joint
embeddings across CXR, ECG, and medical text. Using text data as the central
anchor, MEDBind features tri-modality binding, delivering competitive
performance in top-K retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot benchmarks against
established VLPM, and the ability for CXR-to-ECG zero-shot classification and
retrieval. This seamless integration is achieved through combination of
contrastive loss on modality-text pairs with our proposed contrastive loss
function, Edge-Modality Contrastive Loss, fostering a cohesive embedding space
for CXR, ECG, and text. Finally, we demonstrate that MEDBind can improve
downstream tasks by directly integrating CXR and ECG embeddings into a
large-language model for multimodal prompt tuning.

attention module for robotic assisted feeding (RAF). The goal is to acquire
(i.e., scoop) food items from a bowl. However, achieving robust and adaptive
food manipulation is particularly challenging. To deal with this, we propose a
framework that integrates visual perception with imitation learning to enable
the robot to handle diverse scenarios during scooping. Our approach, named AVIL
(adaptive visual imitation learning), exhibits adaptability and robustness
across different bowl configurations in terms of material, size, and position,
as well as diverse food types including granular, semi-solid, and liquid, even
in the presence of distractors. We validate the effectiveness of our approach
by conducting experiments on a real robot. We also compare its performance with
a baseline. The results demonstrate improvement over the baseline across all
scenarios, with an enhancement of up to 2.5 times in terms of a success metric.
Notably, our model, trained solely on data from a transparent glass bowl
containing granular cereals, showcases generalization ability when tested
zero-shot on other bowl configurations with different types of food.

                                        <span>  The domain of 3D talking head generation has witnessed significant progress
in recent years. A notable challenge in this field consists in blending
speech-related motions with expression dynamics, which is primarily caused by
the lack of comprehensive 3D datasets that combine diversity in spoken
sentences with a variety of facial expressions. Whereas literature works
attempted to exploit 2D video data and parametric 3D models as a workaround,
these still show limitations when jointly modeling the two motions. In this
work, we address this problem from a different perspective, and propose an
innovative data-driven technique that we used for creating a synthetic dataset,
called EmoVOCA, obtained by combining a collection of inexpressive 3D talking
heads and a set of 3D expressive sequences. To demonstrate the advantages of
this approach, and the quality of the dataset, we then designed and trained an
emotional 3D talking head generator that accepts a 3D face, an audio file, an
emotion label, and an intensity value as inputs, and learns to animate the
audio-synchronized lip movements with expressive traits of the face.
Comprehensive experiments, both quantitative and qualitative, using our data
and generator evidence superior ability in synthesizing convincing animations,
when compared with the best performing methods in the literature. Our code and
pre-trained model will be made available.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in visual reasoning (VR), particularly with the aid of Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), show promise but require access to large-scale
datasets and face challenges such as high computational costs and limited
generalization capabilities. Compositional visual reasoning approaches have
emerged as effective strategies; however, they heavily rely on the commonsense
knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform planning,
reasoning, or both, without considering the effect of their decisions on the
visual reasoning process, which can lead to errors or failed procedures. To
address these challenges, we introduce HYDRA, a multi-stage dynamic
compositional visual reasoning framework designed for reliable and
incrementally progressive general reasoning. HYDRA integrates three essential
modules: a planner, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent serving as a cognitive
controller, and a reasoner. The planner and reasoner modules utilize an LLM to
generate instruction samples and executable code from the selected instruction,
respectively, while the RL agent dynamically interacts with these modules,
making high-level decisions on selection of the best instruction sample given
information from the historical state stored through a feedback loop. This
adaptable design enables HYDRA to adjust its actions based on previous feedback
received during the reasoning process, leading to more reliable reasoning
outputs and ultimately enhancing its overall effectiveness. Our framework
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various VR tasks on four different
widely-used datasets.

environments, which is more challenging and practical than traditional domain
adaptation. In this scenario, the model is prone to overfitting noisy labels,
resulting in a more pronounced domain shift and a notable decline in the
overall model performance. Previous methods employed prototype methods for
domain adaptation on robust feature spaces. However, these approaches struggle
to effectively classify classes with similar features under noisy environments.
To address this issue, we propose a new method to detect and correct confusing
class pair. We first divide classes into easy and hard classes based on the
small loss criterion. We then leverage the top-2 predictions for each sample
after aligning the source and target domain to find the confusing pair in the
hard classes. We apply label correction to the noisy samples within the
confusing pair. With the proposed label correction method, we can train our
model with more accurate labels. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its favorable performance compared
with existing state-of-the-art methods. Our codes are publicly available at

processing, their irregular and combinatorial nature hinders their suitability
for learning-based applications. In this work, we introduce a novel learnable
mesh representation through a set of local 3D sample Points and their
associated Normals and Quadric error metrics (QEM) w.r.t. the underlying shape,
which we denote PoNQ. A global mesh is directly derived from PoNQ by
efficiently leveraging the knowledge of the local quadric errors. Besides
marking the first use of QEM within a neural shape representation, our
contribution guarantees both topological and geometrical properties by ensuring
that a PoNQ mesh does not self-intersect and is always the boundary of a
volume. Notably, our representation does not rely on a regular grid, is
supervised directly by the target surface alone, and also handles open surfaces
with boundaries and/or sharp features. We demonstrate the efficacy of PoNQ
through a learning-based mesh prediction from SDF grids and show that our
method surpasses recent state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both surface
and edge-based metrics.

                                        <span>  The limited availability of 3D medical image datasets, due to privacy
concerns and high collection or annotation costs, poses significant challenges
in the field of medical imaging. While a promising alternative is the use of
synthesized medical data, there are few solutions for realistic 3D medical
image synthesis due to difficulties in backbone design and fewer 3D training
samples compared to 2D counterparts. In this paper, we propose GEM-3D, a novel
generative approach to the synthesis of 3D medical images and the enhancement
of existing datasets using conditional diffusion models. Our method begins with
a 2D slice, noted as the informed slice to serve the patient prior, and
propagates the generation process using a 3D segmentation mask. By decomposing
the 3D medical images into masks and patient prior information, GEM-3D offers a
flexible yet effective solution for generating versatile 3D images from
existing datasets. GEM-3D can enable dataset enhancement by combining informed
slice selection and generation at random positions, along with editable mask
volumes to introduce large variations in diffusion sampling. Moreover, as the
informed slice contains patient-wise information, GEM-3D can also facilitate
counterfactual image synthesis and dataset-level de-enhancement with desired
control. Experiments on brain MRI and abdomen CT images demonstrate that GEM-3D
is capable of synthesizing high-quality 3D medical images with volumetric
consistency, offering a straightforward solution for dataset enhancement during
inference. The code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/GEM-3D.

of industries such as robotics, films, and video games, as it closely mirrors
the complexity of real-world multi-object environments. Early works typically
employ shape retrieval based frameworks which naturally suffer from limited
shape diversity. Recent progresses have been made in shape generation with
powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, which increases the shape
fidelity. However, these approaches separately treat 3D shape generation and
layout generation. The synthesized scenes are usually hampered by layout
collision, which implies that the scene-level fidelity is still under-explored.
In this paper, we aim at generating realistic and reasonable 3D scenes from
scene graph. To enrich the representation capability of the given scene graph
inputs, large language model is utilized to explicitly aggregate the global
graph features with local relationship features. With a unified graph
convolution network (GCN), graph features are extracted from scene graphs
updated via joint layout-shape distribution. During scene generation, an
IoU-based regularization loss is introduced to constrain the predicted 3D
layouts. Benchmarked on the SG-FRONT dataset, our method achieves better 3D
scene synthesis, especially in terms of scene-level fidelity. The source code
will be released after publication.

                                        <span>  Neural radiance fields~(NeRF) have recently been applied to render
large-scale scenes. However, their limited model capacity typically results in
blurred rendering results. Existing large-scale NeRFs primarily address this
limitation by partitioning the scene into blocks, which are subsequently
handled by separate sub-NeRFs. These sub-NeRFs, trained from scratch and
processed independently, lead to inconsistencies in geometry and appearance
across the scene. Consequently, the rendering quality fails to exhibit
significant improvement despite the expansion of model capacity. In this work,
we present global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) that achieves
high-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. Our proposed GF-NeRF utilizes a
two-stage (Global and Focal) architecture and a global-guided training
strategy. The global stage obtains a continuous representation of the entire
scene while the focal stage decomposes the scene into multiple blocks and
further processes them with distinct sub-encoders. Leveraging this two-stage
architecture, sub-encoders only need fine-tuning based on the global encoder,
thus reducing training complexity in the focal stage while maintaining
scene-wide consistency. Spatial information and error information from the
global stage also benefit the sub-encoders to focus on crucial areas and
effectively capture more details of large-scale scenes. Notably, our approach
does not rely on any prior knowledge about the target scene, attributing
GF-NeRF adaptable to various large-scale scene types, including street-view and
aerial-view scenes. We demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity,
natural rendering results on various types of large-scale datasets. Our project

imitation learning and reward shaping, often struggle to adapt to new
scenarios. To tackle this limitation, we propose AnySkill, a novel hierarchical
method that learns physically plausible interactions following open-vocabulary
instructions. Our approach begins by developing a set of atomic actions via a
low-level controller trained via imitation learning. Upon receiving an
open-vocabulary textual instruction, AnySkill employs a high-level policy that
selects and integrates these atomic actions to maximize the CLIP similarity
between the agent's rendered images and the text. An important feature of our
method is the use of image-based rewards for the high-level policy, which
allows the agent to learn interactions with objects without manual reward
engineering. We demonstrate AnySkill's capability to generate realistic and
natural motion sequences in response to unseen instructions of varying lengths,
marking it the first method capable of open-vocabulary physical skill learning
for interactive humanoid agents.

                                        <span>  Traditionally, segmentation algorithms require dense annotations for
training, demanding significant annotation efforts, particularly within the 3D
medical imaging field. Scribble-supervised learning emerges as a possible
solution to this challenge, promising a reduction in annotation efforts when
creating large-scale datasets. Recently, a plethora of methods for optimized
learning from scribbles have been proposed, but have so far failed to position
scribble annotation as a beneficial alternative. We relate this shortcoming to
two major issues: 1) the complex nature of many methods which deeply ties them
to the underlying segmentation model, thus preventing a migration to more
powerful state-of-the-art models as the field progresses and 2) the lack of a
systematic evaluation to validate consistent performance across the broader
medical domain, resulting in a lack of trust when applying these methods to new
segmentation problems. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive
scribble supervision benchmark consisting of seven datasets covering a diverse
set of anatomies and pathologies imaged with varying modalities. We furthermore
propose the systematic use of partial losses, i.e. losses that are only
computed on annotated voxels. Contrary to most existing methods, these losses
can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art segmentation methods,
enabling them to learn from scribble annotations while preserving their
original loss formulations. Our evaluation using nnU-Net reveals that while
most existing methods suffer from a lack of generalization, the proposed
approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance. Thanks to its
simplicity, our approach presents an embarrassingly simple yet effective
solution to the challenges of scribble supervision. Source code as well as our
extensive scribble benchmarking suite will be made publicly available upon
publication.

of tumors or the primary origin of metastases. These models require large
datasets for training, which must be anonymized to prevent possible patient
identity leaks. This study demonstrates that even relatively simple deep
learning algorithms can re-identify patients in large histopathology datasets
with substantial accuracy. We evaluated our algorithms on two TCIA datasets
including lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
We also demonstrate the algorithm's performance on an in-house dataset of
meningioma tissue. We predicted the source patient of a slide with F1 scores of
50.16 % and 52.30 % on the LSCC and LUAD datasets, respectively, and with 62.31
% on our meningioma dataset. Based on our findings, we formulated a risk
assessment scheme to estimate the risk to the patient's privacy prior to
publication.

                                        <span>  At present, large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited impressive
generalization capabilities in understanding and generating visual signals.
However, they currently still lack sufficient capability to perceive low-level
visual quality akin to human perception. Can LMMs achieve this and show the
same degree of generalization in this regard? If so, not only could the
versatility of LMMs be further enhanced, but also the challenge of poor
cross-dataset performance in the field of visual quality assessment could be
addressed. In this paper, we explore this question and provide the answer
"Yes!". As the result of this initial exploration, we present VisualCritic, the
first LMM for broad-spectrum image subjective quality assessment. VisualCritic
can be used across diverse data right out of box, without any requirements of
dataset-specific adaptation operations like conventional specialist models. As
an instruction-following LMM, VisualCritic enables new capabilities of (1)
quantitatively measuring the perceptual quality of given images in terms of
their Mean Opinion Score (MOS), noisiness, colorfulness, sharpness, and other
numerical indicators, (2) qualitatively evaluating visual quality and providing
explainable descriptions, (3) discerning whether a given image is AI-generated
or photographic. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VisualCritic
by comparing it with other open-source LMMs and conventional specialist models
over both AI-generated and photographic images.

time-consuming endeavor. Compared to conventional Data Augmentation (DA)
techniques (e.g. cropping and rotation), exploiting prevailing diffusion models
for data generation has received scant attention in classification tasks.
Existing generative DA methods either inadequately bridge the domain gap
between real-world and synthesized images, or inherently suffer from a lack of
diversity. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a new
classification-oriented framework DreamDA, which enables data synthesis and
label generation by way of diffusion models. DreamDA generates diverse samples
that adhere to the original data distribution by considering training images in
the original data as seeds and perturbing their reverse diffusion process. In
addition, since the labels of the generated data may not align with the labels
of their corresponding seed images, we introduce a self-training paradigm for
generating pseudo labels and training classifiers using the synthesized data.
Extensive experiments across four tasks and five datasets demonstrate
consistent improvements over strong baselines, revealing the efficacy of
DreamDA in synthesizing high-quality and diverse images with accurate labels.

up with the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it faces more
challenges to be resolved. Very recent works enable LVLMs to localize
object-level visual contents and ground text to them. Nonetheless, current
LVLMs still struggle to precisely understand visual relations due to the lack
of relevant data. In this work, we present RelationVLM, a large vision-language
model capable of comprehending various levels and types of relations whether
across multiple images or within a video. Specifically, we devise a multi-stage
relation-aware training scheme and a series of corresponding data configuration
strategies to bestow RelationVLM with the capabilities of understanding
semantic relations, temporal associations and geometric transforms. Extensive
case studies and quantitative evaluations show RelationVLM has strong
capability in understanding such relations and emerges impressive in-context
capability of reasoning from few-shot examples by comparison. This work fosters
the advancements of LVLMs by enabling them to support a wider range of
downstream applications toward artificial general intelligence.

key for cardiac function assessment through echocardiography. However,
traditional methods face several limitations: they require extensive amounts of

unsupervised and training-free method, our novel approach leverages
unsupervised segmentation to enhance fault tolerance against segmentation
inaccuracies. By identifying anchor points and analyzing directional
deformation, we effectively reduce dependence on the accuracy of initial
segmentation images and enhance fault tolerance, all while improving
robustness. Tested on Echo-dynamic and CAMUS datasets, our method achieves
comparable accuracy to learning-based models without their associated

                                        <span>  In this paper, we demonstrate a total disentanglement of font images. Total
disentanglement is a neural network-based method for decomposing each font
image nonlinearly and completely into its style and content (i.e., character
class) features. It uses a simple but careful training procedure to extract the
common style feature from all `A'-`Z' images in the same font and the common
content feature from all `A' (or another class) images in different fonts.
These disentangled features guarantee the reconstruction of the original font
image. Various experiments have been conducted to understand the performance of
total disentanglement. First, it is demonstrated that total disentanglement is
achievable with very high accuracy; this is experimental proof of the
long-standing open question, ``Does `A'-ness exist?'' Hofstadter (1985).
Second, it is demonstrated that the disentangled features produced by total
disentanglement apply to a variety of tasks, including font recognition,
character recognition, and one-shot font image generation.

                                        <span>  Gaze following aims to interpret human-scene interactions by predicting the
person's focal point of gaze. Prevailing approaches often use multi-modality
inputs, most of which adopt a two-stage framework. Hence their performance
highly depends on the previous prediction accuracy. Others use a
single-modality approach with complex decoders, increasing network
computational load. Inspired by the remarkable success of pre-trained plain
Vision Transformers (ViTs), we introduce a novel single-modality gaze following
framework, ViTGaze. In contrast to previous methods, ViTGaze creates a brand
new gaze following framework based mainly on powerful encoders (dec. param.
less than 1%). Our principal insight lies in that the inter-token interactions
within self-attention can be transferred to interactions between humans and
scenes. Leveraging this presumption, we formulate a framework consisting of a
4D interaction encoder and a 2D spatial guidance module to extract human-scene
interaction information from self-attention maps. Furthermore, our
investigation reveals that ViT with self-supervised pre-training exhibits an
enhanced ability to extract correlated information. A large number of
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
method. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among all
single-modality methods (3.4% improvement on AUC, 5.1% improvement on AP) and
very comparable performance against multi-modality methods with 59% number of
parameters less.

                                        <span>  Machine learning models can perform well on in-distribution data but often
fail on biased subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data,
hindering the robustness of models for reliable applications. Such subgroups
are typically unknown due to the absence of subgroup labels. Discovering biased
subgroups is the key to understanding models' failure modes and further
improving models' robustness. Most previous works of subgroup discovery make an
implicit assumption that models only underperform on a single biased subgroup,
which does not hold on in-the-wild data where multiple biased subgroups exist.
  In this work, we propose Decomposition, Interpretation, and Mitigation (DIM),
a novel method to address a more challenging but also more practical problem of
discovering multiple biased subgroups in image classifiers. Our approach
decomposes the image features into multiple components that represent multiple
subgroups. This decomposition is achieved via a bilinear dimension reduction
method, Partial Least Square (PLS), guided by useful supervision from the image
classifier. We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup
component by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language
foundation models. Finally, DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups
simultaneously via two strategies, including the data- and model-centric
strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased
subgroups. Furthermore, DIM uncovers the failure modes of the classifier on
Hard ImageNet, showcasing its broader applicability to understanding model bias
in image classifiers. The code is available at

of objects, which convey spectral-spatial information and help improve the
performance of various image processing tasks. Numerous techniques have been
created to extend the application of total variation regularization in
restoring multispectral images, for example, based on channel coupling and
adaptive total variation regularization. The primary contribution of this paper
is to propose and develop a new multispectral total variation regularization in
a generalized opponent transformation domain instead of the original
multispectral image domain. Here opponent transformations for multispectral
images are generalized from a well-known opponent transformation for color
images. We will explore the properties of generalized opponent transformation
total variation (GOTTV) regularization and the corresponding optimization
formula for multispectral image restoration. To evaluate the effectiveness of
the new GOTTV method, we provide numerical examples that showcase its superior
performance compared to existing multispectral image total variation methods,
using criteria such as MPSNR and MSSIM.

histology studies that require domain expertise. Various semi-supervised
learning approaches have been developed to work with limited ground truth
annotations, such as the popular teacher-student models. However, hierarchical
prediction uncertainty within the student model (intra-uncertainty) and image
prediction uncertainty (inter-uncertainty) have not been fully utilized by
existing methods. To address these issues, we first propose a novel inter- and
intra-uncertainty regularization method to measure and constrain both inter-
and intra-inconsistencies in the teacher-student architecture. We also propose
a new two-stage network with pseudo-mask guided feature aggregation (PG-FANet)
as the segmentation model. The two-stage structure complements with the
uncertainty regularization strategy to avoid introducing extra modules in
solving uncertainties and the aggregation mechanisms enable multi-scale and
multi-stage feature integration. Comprehensive experimental results over the
MoNuSeg and CRAG datasets show that our PG-FANet outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods and our semi-supervised learning framework yields
competitive performance with a limited amount of labeled data.

restoration, they are criticized for two problems: 1) slow training and
inference speed, and 2) failure in preserving identity and recovering
fine-grained facial details. In this work, we propose WaveFace to solve the
problems in the frequency domain, where low- and high-frequency components
decomposed by wavelet transformation are considered individually to maximize
authenticity as well as efficiency. The diffusion model is applied to recover
the low-frequency component only, which presents general information of the
original image but 1/16 in size. To preserve the original identity, the
generation is conditioned on the low-frequency component of low-quality images
at each denoising step. Meanwhile, high-frequency components at multiple
decomposition levels are handled by a unified network, which recovers complex
facial details in a single step. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets show
that: 1) WaveFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in authenticity,
especially in terms of identity preservation, and 2) authentic images are
restored with the efficiency 10x faster than existing diffusion model-based BFR
methods.

deep-learning models have presented the best results. However, the traditional
way of training those models from many pre-annotated images leaves several
unanswered questions. Hence methodologies, such as Feature Learning from Image
Markers (FLIM), have involved an expert in the learning loop to reduce human
effort in data annotation and build models sufficiently deep for a given
problem. FLIM has been successfully used to create encoders, estimating the
filters of all convolutional layers from patches centered at marker voxels. In
this work, we present Multi-Step (MS) FLIM - a user-assisted approach to
estimating and selecting the most relevant filters from multiple FLIM
executions. MS-FLIM is used only for the first convolutional layer, and the
results already indicate improvement over FLIM. For evaluation, we build a
simple U-shaped encoder-decoder network, named sU-Net, for glioblastoma
segmentation using T1Gd and FLAIR MRI scans, varying the encoder's training
method, using FLIM, MS-FLIM, and backpropagation algorithm. Also, we compared
these sU-Nets with two State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep-learning models using two
datasets. The results show that the sU-Net based on MS-FLIM outperforms the
other training methods and achieves effectiveness within the standard
deviations of the SOTA models.

                                        <span>  Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) is among the most popular and effective
techniques in the field of face generation and editing, thanks to its good
generation quality and the versatility is brings along. Recent works attempted
to go beyond the standard GAN-based framework, and started to explore Diffusion
Models (DMs) for this task as these stand out with respect to GANs in terms of
both quality and diversity. On the other hand, DMs lack in fine-grained
controllability and reproducibility. To address that, in this paper we propose
a SIS framework based on a novel Latent Diffusion Model architecture for human
face generation and editing that is both able to reproduce and manipulate a
real reference image and generate diversity-driven results. The proposed system
utilizes both SPADE normalization and cross-attention layers to merge shape and
style information and, by doing so, allows for a precise control over each of
the semantic parts of the human face. This was not possible with previous
methods in the state of the art. Finally, we performed an extensive set of
experiments to prove that our model surpasses current state of the art, both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

                                        <span>  Inspired by the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) that can truly
understand human language, significant progress has been made in aligning
other, non-language, modalities to be `understandable' by an LLM, primarily via
converting their samples into a sequence of embedded language-like tokens
directly fed into the LLM (decoder) input stream. However, so far limited
attention has been given to transferring (and evaluating) one of the core LLM
capabilities to the emerging VLMs, namely the In-Context Learning (ICL)
ability, or in other words to guide VLMs to desired target downstream tasks or
output structure using in-context image+text demonstrations. In this work, we
dive deeper into analyzing the capabilities of some of the state-of-the-art
VLMs to follow ICL instructions, discovering them to be somewhat lacking. We
discover that even models that underwent large-scale mixed modality
pre-training and were implicitly guided to make use of interleaved image and
text information (intended to consume helpful context from multiple images)
under-perform when prompted with few-shot (ICL) demonstrations, likely due to
their lack of `direct' ICL instruction tuning. To test this conjecture, we
propose a simple, yet surprisingly effective, strategy of extending a common
VLM alignment framework with ICL support, methodology, and curriculum. We
explore, analyze, and provide insights into effective data mixes, leading up to
a significant 21.03% (and 11.3% on average) ICL performance boost over the
strongest VLM baselines and a variety of ICL benchmarks. We also contribute new
benchmarks for ICL evaluation in VLMs and discuss their advantages over the
prior art.

                                        <span>  Fully-supervised category-level pose estimation aims to determine the 6-DoF
poses of unseen instances from known categories, requiring expensive mannual
labeling costs. Recently, various self-supervised category-level pose
estimation methods have been proposed to reduce the requirement of the
annotated datasets. However, most methods rely on synthetic data or 3D CAD
model for self-supervised training, and they are typically limited to
addressing single-object pose problems without considering multi-objective
tasks or shape reconstruction. To overcome these challenges and limitations, we
introduce a diffusion-driven self-supervised network for multi-object shape
reconstruction and categorical pose estimation, only leveraging the shape
priors. Specifically, to capture the SE(3)-equivariant pose features and 3D
scale-invariant shape information, we present a Prior-Aware Pyramid 3D Point
Transformer in our network. This module adopts a point convolutional layer with
radial-kernels for pose-aware learning and a 3D scale-invariant graph
convolution layer for object-level shape representation, respectively.
Furthermore, we introduce a pretrain-to-refine self-supervised training
paradigm to train our network. It enables proposed network to capture the
associations between shape priors and observations, addressing the challenge of
intra-class shape variations by utilising the diffusion mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted on four public datasets and a self-built dataset
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
self-supervised category-level baselines and even surpasses some
fully-supervised instance-level and category-level methods.

                                        <span>  Holistic understanding of urban scenes based on RGB images is a challenging
yet important problem. It encompasses understanding both the geometry and
appearance to enable novel view synthesis, parsing semantic labels, and
tracking moving objects. Despite considerable progress, existing approaches
often focus on specific aspects of this task and require additional inputs such
as LiDAR scans or manually annotated 3D bounding boxes. In this paper, we
introduce a novel pipeline that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for holistic
urban scene understanding. Our main idea involves the joint optimization of
geometry, appearance, semantics, and motion using a combination of static and
dynamic 3D Gaussians, where moving object poses are regularized via physical
constraints. Our approach offers the ability to render new viewpoints in
real-time, yielding 2D and 3D semantic information with high accuracy, and
reconstruct dynamic scenes, even in scenarios where 3D bounding box detection
are highly noisy. Experimental results on KITTI, KITTI-360, and Virtual KITTI 2
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

                                        <span>  In visual recognition, scale bias is a key challenge due to the imbalance of
object and image size distribution inherent in real scene datasets.
Conventional solutions involve injecting scale invariance priors, oversampling
the dataset at different scales during training, or adjusting scale at
inference. While these strategies mitigate scale bias to some extent, their
ability to adapt across diverse datasets is limited. Besides, they increase
computational load during training and latency during inference. In this work,
we use adaptive attentional processing -- oversampling salient object regions
by warping images in-place during training. Discovering that shifting the
source scale distribution improves backbone features, we developed a
instance-level warping guidance aimed at object region sampling to mitigate
source scale bias in domain adaptation. Our approach improves adaptation across
geographies, lighting and weather conditions, is agnostic to the task, domain
adaptation algorithm, saliency guidance, and underlying model architecture.

to privacy-preserving action recognition. Existing approaches often suffer from
issues arising through obfuscation being applied globally and a lack of
interpretability. Global obfuscation hides privacy sensitive regions, but also
contextual regions important for action recognition. Lack of interpretability
erodes trust in these new technologies. We highlight the limitations of current
paradigms and propose a solution: Human selected privacy templates that yield
interpretability by design, an obfuscation scheme that selectively hides
attributes and also induces temporal consistency, which is important in action
recognition. Our approach is architecture agnostic and directly modifies input
imagery, while existing approaches generally require architecture training. Our
approach offers more flexibility, as no retraining is required, and outperforms
alternatives on three widely used datasets.

                                        <span>  With diverse presentation forgery methods emerging continually, detecting the
authenticity of images has drawn growing attention. Although existing methods
have achieved impressive accuracy in training dataset detection, they still
perform poorly in the unseen domain and suffer from forgery of irrelevant
information such as background and identity, affecting generalizability. To
solve this problem, we proposed a novel framework Selective Domain-Invariant
Feature (SDIF), which reduces the sensitivity to face forgery by fusing content
features and styles. Specifically, we first use a Farthest-Point Sampling (FPS)
training strategy to construct a task-relevant style sample representation
space for fusing with content features. Then, we propose a dynamic feature
extraction module to generate features with diverse styles to improve the
performance and effectiveness of the feature extractor. Finally, a domain
separation strategy is used to retain domain-related features to help
distinguish between real and fake faces. Both qualitative and quantitative
results in existing benchmarks and proposals demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.

                                        <span>  Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) involves determining the geographical
location of a query image by matching it with a corresponding GPS-tagged
reference image. Current state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on
training models with labeled paired images, incurring substantial annotation
costs and training burdens. In this study, we investigate the adaptation of
frozen models for CVGL without requiring ground truth pair labels. We observe
that training on unlabeled cross-view images presents significant challenges,
including the need to establish relationships within unlabeled data and
reconcile view discrepancies between uncertain queries and references. To
address these challenges, we propose a self-supervised learning framework to
train a learnable adapter for a frozen Foundation Model (FM). This adapter is
designed to map feature distributions from diverse views into a uniform space
using unlabeled data exclusively. To establish relationships within unlabeled
data, we introduce an Expectation-Maximization-based Pseudo-labeling module,
which iteratively estimates associations between cross-view features and
optimizes the adapter. To maintain the robustness of the FM's representation,
we incorporate an information consistency module with a reconstruction loss,
ensuring that adapted features retain strong discriminative ability across
views. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
significant improvements over vanilla FMs and competitive accuracy compared to
supervised methods, while necessitating fewer training parameters and relying
solely on unlabeled data. Evaluation of our adaptation for task-specific models
further highlights its broad applicability.

                                        <span>  Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in clinic disease diagnosis and
medical image analysis. However, labeling medical images for segmentation task
is tough due to the indispensable domain expertise of radiologists.
Furthermore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of medical images, it is
impractical to build a centralized segmentation dataset from different medical
institutions. Federated learning aims to train a shared model of isolated
clients without local data exchange which aligns well with the scarcity and
privacy characteristics of medical data. To solve the problem of labeling hard,
many advanced semi-supervised methods have been proposed in a centralized data
setting. As for federated learning, how to conduct semi-supervised learning
under this distributed scenario is worth investigating. In this work, we
propose a novel federated semi-supervised learning framework for medical image
segmentation. The intra-client and inter-client consistency learning are
introduced to smooth predictions at the data level and avoid confirmation bias
of local models. They are achieved with the assistance of a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) trained collaboratively by clients. The added VAE model plays
three roles: 1) extracting latent low-dimensional features of all labeled and
unlabeled data; 2) performing a novel type of data augmentation in calculating
intra-client consistency loss; 3) utilizing the generative ability of itself to
conduct inter-client consistency distillation. The proposed framework is
compared with other federated semi-supervised or self-supervised learning
methods. The experimental results illustrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art method while avoiding a lot of computation and communication
overhead.

While pre-training offers clear advantages for downstream learning, it also
endows downstream models with shared adversarial vulnerabilities that can be
easily identified through the open-sourced foundation model. In this work, we
expose such vulnerabilities in CLIP's downstream models and show that
foundation models can serve as a basis for attacking their downstream systems.
In particular, we propose a simple yet effective adversarial attack strategy
termed Patch Representation Misalignment (PRM). Solely based on open-sourced
CLIP vision encoders, this method produces adversaries that simultaneously fool
more than 20 downstream models spanning 4 common vision-language tasks
(semantic segmentation, object detection, image captioning and visual
question-answering). Our findings highlight the concerning safety risks
introduced by the extensive usage of public foundational models in the
development of downstream systems, calling for extra caution in these
scenarios.

that the proposed method can potentially form a basis for development of

paper, we introduce WaterVG, the first visual grounding dataset designed for
USV-based waterway perception based on human intention prompts. WaterVG
encompasses prompts describing multiple targets, with annotations at the
instance level including bounding boxes and masks. Notably, WaterVG includes
11,568 samples with 34,950 referred targets, which integrates both visual and
radar characteristics captured by monocular camera and millimeter-wave (mmWave)
radar, enabling a finer granularity of text prompts. Furthermore, we propose a

multi-task model based on the one-stage paradigm with a designed Phased
Heterogeneous Modality Fusion (PHMF) structure, including Adaptive Radar
Weighting (ARW) and Multi-Head Slim Cross Attention (MHSCA). In specific, MHSCA
is a low-cost and efficient fusion module with a remarkably small parameter
count and FLOPs, elegantly aligning and fusing scenario context information
captured by two sensors with linguistic features, which can effectively address
tasks of referring expression comprehension and segmentation based on
fine-grained prompts. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations have been

eliminates the need for an initial pose guess that is proximate to the sought

deduce the color for each ray through pixel-level view synthesis. The camera
pose can then be estimated as the solution to a Least Squares problem by
selecting correspondences between the query image and the resulting bundle. We
facilitate this process through a learned attention mechanism, bridging the

matching rays pertinent to the image. Through synthetic and real evaluation
settings, we show that our method can improve the angular and translation error
accuracy by 80.1% and 67.3%, respectively, compared to iNeRF while performing
at 34fps on consumer hardware and not requiring the initial pose guess.

                                        <span>  Animatronic robots aim to enable natural human-robot interaction through
lifelike facial expressions. However, generating realistic, speech-synchronized
robot expressions is challenging due to the complexities of facial biomechanics
and responsive motion synthesis. This paper presents a principled,
skinning-centric approach to drive animatronic robot facial expressions from
speech. The proposed approach employs linear blend skinning (LBS) as the core
representation to guide tightly integrated innovations in embodiment design and
motion synthesis. LBS informs the actuation topology, enables human expression
retargeting, and allows speech-driven facial motion generation. The proposed
approach is capable of generating highly realistic, real-time facial
expressions from speech on an animatronic face, significantly advancing robots'
ability to replicate nuanced human expressions for natural interaction.

                                        <span>  Despite significant advancements in image customization with diffusion
models, current methods still have several limitations: 1) unintended changes
in non-target areas when regenerating the entire image; 2) guidance solely by a
reference image or text descriptions; and 3) time-consuming fine-tuning, which
limits their practical application. In response, we introduce a tuning-free
framework for simultaneous text-image-guided image customization, enabling
precise editing of specific image regions within seconds. Our approach
preserves the semantic features of the reference image subject while allowing
modification of detailed attributes based on text descriptions. To achieve
this, we propose an innovative attention blending strategy that blends
self-attention features in the UNet decoder during the denoising process. To
our knowledge, this is the first tuning-free method that concurrently utilizes
text and image guidance for image customization in specific regions. Our
approach outperforms previous methods in both human and quantitative
evaluations, providing an efficient solution for various practical
applications, such as image synthesis, design, and creative photography.

expensive finetuning, our approach leverages LAtent SPatial Alignment (LASPA)
to efficiently preserve image details. We demonstrate how the diffusion process
is amenable to spatial guidance using a reference image, leading to
semantically coherent edits. This eliminates the need for complex optimization

to previous methods. Additionally, our method avoids the storage requirements
associated with large finetuned models. These advantages make our approach
particularly well-suited for editing on mobile devices and applications
demanding rapid response times. While simple and fast, our method achieves
62-71\% preference in a user-study and significantly better model-based editing
strength and image preservation scores.

                                        <span>  Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) has garnered significant attention and
experienced rapid development. However, the recent development of IAD approach
has encountered certain difficulties due to dataset limitations. On the one
hand, most of the state-of-the-art methods have achieved saturation (over 99%
in AUROC) on mainstream datasets such as MVTec, and the differences of methods
cannot be well distinguished, leading to a significant gap between public
datasets and actual application scenarios. On the other hand, the research on
various new practical anomaly detection settings is limited by the scale of the
dataset, posing a risk of overfitting in evaluation results. Therefore, we
propose a large-scale, Real-world, and multi-view Industrial Anomaly Detection
dataset, named Real-IAD, which contains 150K high-resolution images of 30
different objects, an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets. It has
a larger range of defect area and ratio proportions, making it more challenging
than previous datasets. To make the dataset closer to real application
scenarios, we adopted a multi-view shooting method and proposed sample-level
evaluation metrics. In addition, beyond the general unsupervised anomaly
detection setting, we propose a new setting for Fully Unsupervised Industrial
Anomaly Detection (FUIAD) based on the observation that the yield rate in
industrial production is usually greater than 60%, which has more practical
application value. Finally, we report the results of popular IAD methods on the
Real-IAD dataset, providing a highly challenging benchmark to promote the
development of the IAD field.

ideally suited for object detection, especially under scenarios with motion
blur and challenging lighting conditions. However, while most existing
approaches prioritize optimizing spatiotemporal representations with advanced
detection backbones and early aggregation functions, the crucial issue of
adaptive event sampling remains largely unaddressed. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), which operate on an event-driven paradigm through sparse spike
communication, emerge as a natural fit for addressing this challenge. In this
study, we discover that the neural dynamics of spiking neurons align closely
with the behavior of an ideal temporal event sampler. Motivated by this
insight, we propose a novel adaptive sampling module that leverages recurrent
convolutional SNNs enhanced with temporal memory, facilitating a fully
end-to-end learnable framework for event-based detection. Additionally, we
introduce Residual Potential Dropout (RPD) and Spike-Aware Training (SAT) to
regulate potential distribution and address performance degradation encountered
in spike-based sampling modules. Through rigorous testing on neuromorphic
datasets for event-based detection, our approach demonstrably surpasses
existing state-of-the-art spike-based methods, achieving superior performance
with significantly fewer parameters and time steps. For instance, our method
achieves a 4.4\% mAP improvement on the Gen1 dataset, while requiring 38\%
fewer parameters and three time steps. Moreover, the applicability and
effectiveness of our adaptive sampling methodology extend beyond SNNs, as
demonstrated through further validation on conventional non-spiking detection
models.

tackle challenges such as occlusion and missed detection in multi-object
tracking and detection. Recent advancements in multi-view detection and 3D
object recognition have significantly improved performance by strategically
projecting all views onto the ground plane and conducting detection analysis
from a Bird's Eye View. In this paper, we compare modern lifting methods, both
parameter-free and parameterized, to multi-view aggregation. Additionally, we
present an architecture that aggregates the features of multiple times steps to
learn robust detection and combines appearance- and motion-based cues for
tracking. Most current tracking approaches either focus on pedestrians or
vehicles. In our work, we combine both branches and add new challenges to
multi-view detection with cross-scene setups. Our method generalizes to three
public datasets across two domains: (1) pedestrian: Wildtrack and MultiviewX,
and (2) roadside perception: Synthehicle, achieving state-of-the-art

                                        <span>  Compound Expression Recognition (CER) plays a crucial role in interpersonal
interactions. Due to the existence of Compound Expressions , human emotional
expressions are complex, requiring consideration of both local and global
facial expressions to make judgments. In this paper, to address this issue, we
propose a solution based on ensemble learning methods for Compound Expression
Recognition. Specifically, our task is classification, where we train three
expression classification models based on convolutional networks, Vision
Transformers, and multi-scale local attention networks. Then, through model
ensemble using late fusion, we merge the outputs of multiple models to predict
the final result. Our method achieves high accuracy on RAF-DB and is able to
recognize expressions through zero-shot on certain portions of C-EXPR-DB.

led to significant progress in zero-/few-shot anomaly detection within natural
image domains. However, the substantial domain divergence between natural and
medical images limits the effectiveness of these methodologies in medical
anomaly detection. This paper introduces a novel lightweight multi-level
adaptation and comparison framework to repurpose the CLIP model for medical
anomaly detection. Our approach integrates multiple residual adapters into the
pre-trained visual encoder, enabling a stepwise enhancement of visual features
across different levels. This multi-level adaptation is guided by multi-level,
pixel-wise visual-language feature alignment loss functions, which recalibrate
the model's focus from object semantics in natural imagery to anomaly
identification in medical images. The adapted features exhibit improved
generalization across various medical data types, even in zero-shot scenarios
where the model encounters unseen medical modalities and anatomical regions
during training. Our experiments on medical anomaly detection benchmarks
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art
models, with an average AUC improvement of 6.24% and 7.33% for anomaly
classification, 2.03% and 2.37% for anomaly segmentation, under the zero-shot
and few-shot settings, respectively. Source code is available at:

                                        <span>  The partial label challenge in Multi-Label Class-Incremental Learning (MLCIL)
arises when only the new classes are labeled during training, while past and
future labels remain unavailable. This issue leads to a proliferation of
false-positive errors due to erroneously high confidence multi-label
predictions, exacerbating catastrophic forgetting within the disjoint label
space. In this paper, we aim to refine multi-label confidence calibration in
MLCIL and propose a Confidence Self-Calibration (CSC) approach. Firstly, for
label relationship calibration, we introduce a class-incremental graph
convolutional network that bridges the isolated label spaces by constructing
learnable, dynamically extended label relationship graph. Then, for confidence
calibration, we present a max-entropy regularization for each multi-label
increment, facilitating confidence self-calibration through the penalization of
over-confident output distributions. Our approach attains new state-of-the-art
results in MLCIL tasks on both MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, with the
calibration of label confidences confirmed through our methodology.

                                        <span>  End-to-end autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable progress. However, the
extensive deployment of autonomous vehicles has yet to be realized, primarily
due to 1) inefficient multi-modal environment perception: how to integrate data
from multi-modal sensors more efficiently; 2) non-human-like scene
understanding: how to effectively locate and predict critical risky agents in
traffic scenarios like an experienced driver. To overcome these challenges, in
this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal fusion transformer incorporating Driver
Attention (M2DA) for autonomous driving. To better fuse multi-modal data and
achieve higher alignment between different modalities, a novel
Lidar-Vision-Attention-based Fusion (LVAFusion) module is proposed. By
incorporating driver attention, we empower the human-like scene understanding
ability to autonomous vehicles to identify crucial areas within complex
scenarios precisely and ensure safety. We conduct experiments on the CARLA
simulator and achieve state-of-the-art performance with less data in
closed-loop benchmarks. Source codes are available at

a key role in robotics, Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. Recent advancements in dense representation SLAM have highlighted
the potential of leveraging neural scene representation and 3D Gaussian
representation for high-fidelity spatial representation. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense representation SLAM approach with a fusion of Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (G-ICP) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). In contrast
to existing methods, we utilize a single Gaussian map for both tracking and
mapping, resulting in mutual benefits. Through the exchange of covariances
between tracking and mapping processes with scale alignment techniques, we
minimize redundant computations and achieve an efficient system. Additionally,
we enhance tracking accuracy and mapping quality through our keyframe selection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
showing an incredibly fast speed up to 107 FPS (for the entire system) and
superior quality of the reconstructed map.

an exhaustive set of coarse-level candidates for matching, HCPM selectively
concentrates on a concise subset of informative candidates, resulting in fewer

a self-pruning stage for selecting reliable candidates and an
interactive-pruning stage that identifies correlated patches at the coarse
level. Our results reveal that HCPM significantly surpasses existing methods in

classifying histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). Existing approaches
typically rely on frozen pre-trained models to extract instance features,
neglecting the substantial domain shift between pre-training natural and
histopathological images. To address this issue, we propose PAMT, a novel
Prompt-guided Adaptive Model Transformation framework that enhances MIL
classification performance by seamlessly adapting pre-trained models to the
specific characteristics of histopathology data. To capture the intricate
histopathology distribution, we introduce Representative Patch Sampling (RPS)
and Prototypical Visual Prompt (PVP) to reform the input data, building a
compact while informative representation. Furthermore, to narrow the domain
gap, we introduce Adaptive Model Transformation (AMT) that integrates adapter
blocks within the feature extraction pipeline, enabling the pre-trained models
to learn domain-specific features. We rigorously evaluate our approach on two
publicly available datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC, showcasing substantial
improvements across various MIL models. Our findings affirm the potential of
PAMT to set a new benchmark in WSI classification, underscoring the value of a
targeted reprogramming approach.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce Vox-Fusion++, a multi-maps-based robust dense
tracking and mapping system that seamlessly fuses neural implicit
representations with traditional volumetric fusion techniques. Building upon
the concept of implicit mapping and positioning systems, our approach extends
its applicability to real-world scenarios. Our system employs a voxel-based
neural implicit surface representation, enabling efficient encoding and
optimization of the scene within each voxel. To handle diverse environments
without prior knowledge, we incorporate an octree-based structure for scene
division and dynamic expansion. To achieve real-time performance, we propose a
high-performance multi-process framework. This ensures the system's suitability
for applications with stringent time constraints. Additionally, we adopt the
idea of multi-maps to handle large-scale scenes, and leverage loop detection
and hierarchical pose optimization strategies to reduce long-term pose drift
and remove duplicate geometry. Through comprehensive evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in terms of
reconstruction quality and accuracy across various scenarios. We also show that
our Vox-Fusion++ can be used in augmented reality and collaborative mapping
applications. Our source code will be publicly available at

provides metrically accurate pose tracking and visually realistic
reconstruction. To this end, we first propose a Gaussian densification strategy
based on the rendering loss to map unobserved areas and refine reobserved
areas. Second, we introduce extra regularization parameters to alleviate the
forgetting problem in the continuous mapping problem, where parameters tend to
overfit the latest frame and result in decreasing rendering quality for
previous frames. Both mapping and tracking are performed with Gaussian
parameters by minimizing re-rendering loss in a differentiable way. Compared to
recent neural and concurrently developed gaussian splatting RGBD SLAM
baselines, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the synthetic

                                        <span>  Event cameras have recently been shown beneficial for practical vision tasks,
such as action recognition, thanks to their high temporal resolution, power
efficiency, and reduced privacy concerns. However, current research is hindered
by 1) the difficulty in processing events because of their prolonged duration
and dynamic actions with complex and ambiguous semantics and 2) the redundant
action depiction of the event frame representation with fixed stacks. We find
language naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering it
stunningly superior in reducing semantic uncertainty. In light of this, we
propose ExACT, a novel approach that, for the first time, tackles event-based
action recognition from a cross-modal conceptualizing perspective. Our ExACT
brings two technical contributions. Firstly, we propose an adaptive
fine-grained event (AFE) representation to adaptively filter out the repeated
events for the stationary objects while preserving dynamic ones. This subtly
enhances the performance of ExACT without extra computational cost. Then, we
propose a conceptual reasoning-based uncertainty estimation module, which
simulates the recognition process to enrich the semantic representation. In
particular, conceptual reasoning builds the temporal relation based on the
action semantics, and uncertainty estimation tackles the semantic uncertainty
of actions based on the distributional representation. Experiments show that
our ExACT achieves superior recognition accuracy of 94.83%(+2.23%),
90.10%(+37.47%) and 67.24% on PAF, HARDVS and our SeAct datasets respectively.

                                        <span>  We present UniBind, a flexible and efficient approach that learns a unified
representation space for seven diverse modalities -- images, text, audio, point
cloud, thermal, video, and event data. Existing works, eg., ImageBind, treat
the image as the central modality and build an image-centered representation
space; however, the space may be sub-optimal as it leads to an unbalanced
representation space among all modalities. Moreover, the category names are
directly used to extract text embeddings for the downstream tasks, making it
hardly possible to represent the semantics of multi-modal data. The
'out-of-the-box' insight of our UniBind is to make the alignment center
modality-agnostic and further learn a unified and balanced representation
space, empowered by the large language models (LLMs). UniBind is superior in
its flexible application to all CLIP-style models and delivers remarkable
performance boosts. To make this possible, we 1) construct a knowledge base of
text embeddings with the help of LLMs and multi-modal LLMs; 2) adaptively build
LLM-augmented class-wise embedding center on top of the knowledge base and
encoded visual embeddings; 3) align all the embeddings to the LLM-augmented
embedding center via contrastive learning to achieve a unified and balanced
representation space. UniBind shows strong zero-shot recognition performance
gains over prior arts by an average of 6.36%. Finally, we achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, eg., a 6.75% gain on ImageNet, on the multi-modal
fine-tuning setting while reducing 90% of the learnable parameters.

significant challenges due to the scenes' complexity and the high manual
annotation cost. In this work, we address these challenges by leveraging the
abundance of unlabeled data available. We propose the Perspective Cue Training
(PCT) framework, a novel training framework that utilizes pseudo-labels
generated from unlabeled perspective images using publicly available semantic
segmentation models trained on large street-view datasets. PCT applies a
perspective view task head to the image encoder shared with the BEV
segmentation head, effectively utilizing the unlabeled data to be trained with
the generated pseudo-labels. Since image encoders are present in nearly all
camera-based BEV segmentation architectures, PCT is flexible and applicable to
various existing BEV architectures. PCT can be applied to various settings
where unlabeled data is available. In this paper, we applied PCT for
semi-supervised learning (SSL) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA).
Additionally, we introduce strong input perturbation through Camera Dropout
(CamDrop) and feature perturbation via BEV Feature Dropout (BFD), which are
crucial for enhancing SSL capabilities using our teacher-student framework. Our
comprehensive approach is simple and flexible but yields significant
improvements over various baselines for SSL and UDA, achieving competitive
performances even against the current state-of-the-art.

                                        <span>  Skeleton-aware sign language recognition (SLR) has gained popularity due to
its ability to remain unaffected by background information and its lower
computational requirements. Current methods utilize spatial graph modules and
temporal modules to capture spatial and temporal features, respectively.
However, their spatial graph modules are typically built on fixed graph
structures such as graph convolutional networks or a single learnable graph,
which only partially explore joint relationships. Additionally, a simple
temporal convolution kernel is used to capture temporal information, which may
not fully capture the complex movement patterns of different signers. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a new spatial architecture consisting of
two concurrent branches, which build input-sensitive joint relationships and
incorporates specific domain knowledge for recognition, respectively. These two
branches are followed by an aggregation process to distinguishe important joint
connections. We then propose a new temporal module to model multi-scale
temporal information to capture complex human dynamics. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to previous skeleton-aware methods on four
large-scale SLR benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates superior accuracy
compared to RGB-based methods in most cases while requiring much fewer
computational resources, bringing better accuracy-computation trade-off. Code

                                        <span>  Diffusion-based generative models excel in unconditional generation, as well
as on applied tasks such as image editing and restoration. The success of
diffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks
down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple
denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the
generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step.
However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking
from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency
trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the
probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function
evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this
work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs
(GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss
the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image
manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and
editing. Code: \url{https://github.com/1202kbs/GCTM}

                                        <span>  This paper addresses an interesting yet challenging problem -- source-free
unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) for pinhole-to-panoramic semantic
segmentation -- given only a pinhole image-trained model (i.e., source) and
unlabeled panoramic images (i.e., target). Tackling this problem is nontrivial
due to the semantic mismatches, style discrepancies, and inevitable distortion
of panoramic images. To this end, we propose a novel method that utilizes
Tangent Projection (TP) as it has less distortion and meanwhile slits the
equirectangular projection (ERP) with a fixed FoV to mimic the pinhole images.
Both projections are shown effective in extracting knowledge from the source
model. However, the distinct projection discrepancies between source and target
domains impede the direct knowledge transfer; thus, we propose a panoramic
prototype adaptation module (PPAM) to integrate panoramic prototypes from the
extracted knowledge for adaptation. We then impose the loss constraints on both
predictions and prototypes and propose a cross-dual attention module (CDAM) at
the feature level to better align the spatial and channel characteristics
across the domains and projections. Both knowledge extraction and transfer
processes are synchronously updated to reach the best performance. Extensive
experiments on the synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including outdoor and
indoor scenarios, demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better
performance than prior SFUDA methods for pinhole-to-panoramic adaptation.

                                        <span>  General image fusion aims at integrating important information from
multi-source images. However, due to the significant cross-task gap, the
respective fusion mechanism varies considerably in practice, resulting in
limited performance across subtasks. To handle this problem, we propose a novel
task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) for general image fusion,
adaptively prompting various fusion tasks in a unified model. We borrow the
insight from the mixture of experts (MoE), taking the experts as efficient
tuning adapters to prompt a pre-trained foundation model. These adapters are
shared across different tasks and constrained by mutual information
regularization, ensuring compatibility with different tasks while
complementarity for multi-source images. The task-specific routing networks
customize these adapters to extract task-specific information from different
sources with dynamic dominant intensity, performing adaptive visual feature
prompt fusion. Notably, our TC-MoA controls the dominant intensity bias for
different fusion tasks, successfully unifying multiple fusion tasks in a single
model. Extensive experiments show that TC-MoA outperforms the competing
approaches in learning commonalities while retaining compatibility for general
image fusion (multi-modal, multi-exposure, and multi-focus), and also
demonstrating striking controllability on more generalization experiments. The
code is available at https://github.com/YangSun22/TC-MoA .

applications in medicine, manufacturing as well as training systems for
students in various domains. In this paper we propose a trainable feature
extraction module for deep neural networks. The purpose of this module is to
transform a scanpath into a feature vector which is directly useable for the
deep neural network architecture. Based on the backpropagated error of the deep
neural network, the feature extraction module adapts its parameters to improve
the classification performance. Therefore, our feature extraction module is
jointly trainable with the deep neural network. The motivation to this feature
extraction module is based on classical histogram-based approaches which
usually compute distributions over a scanpath. We evaluated our module on three
public datasets and compared it to the state of the art approaches.

object detection ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as
GPT-4V and Gemini. Our approach consists of a detection prompting toolkit
inspired by high-precision detection priors and a new Chain-of-Thought to
implement these prompts. Specifically, the prompts in the toolkit are designed
to guide the MLLM to focus on regional information (e.g., zooming in), read
coordinates according to measure standards (e.g., overlaying rulers and
compasses), and infer from the contextual information (e.g., overlaying scene
graphs). Building upon these tools, the new detection chain-of-thought can
automatically decompose the task into simple subtasks, diagnose the
predictions, and plan for progressive box refinements. The effectiveness of our
framework is demonstrated across a spectrum of detection tasks, especially hard

to emergence of new application in the domain of visual surveillance, targeted
advertisement, content-based searching, and human-computer interaction etc. Out
of the various techniques in computer vision, face analysis, in particular, has
gained much attention. Several previous studies have tried to explore different
applications of facial feature processing for a variety of tasks, including age
and gender classification. However, despite several previous studies having
explored the problem, the age and gender classification of in-wild human faces
is still far from the achieving the desired levels of accuracy required for
real-world applications. This paper, therefore, attempts to bridge this gap by
proposing a hybrid model that combines self-attention and BiLSTM approaches for
age and gender classification problems. The proposed models performance is
compared with several state-of-the-art model proposed so far. An improvement of
approximately 10percent and 6percent over the state-of-the-art implementations
for age and gender classification, respectively, are noted for the proposed
model. The proposed model is thus found to achieve superior performance and is
found to provide a more generalized learning. The model can, therefore, be
applied as a core classification component in various image processing and
computer vision problems.

                                        <span>  Detecting fake news has received a lot of attention. Many previous methods
concatenate independently encoded unimodal data, ignoring the benefits of
integrated multimodal information. Also, the absence of specialized feature
extraction for text and images further limits these methods. This paper
introduces an end-to-end model called TT-BLIP that applies the bootstrapping
language-image pretraining for unified vision-language understanding and
generation (BLIP) for three types of information: BERT and
BLIP\textsubscript{Txt} for text, ResNet and BLIP\textsubscript{Img} for
images, and bidirectional BLIP encoders for multimodal information. The
Multimodal Tri-Transformer fuses tri-modal features using three types of
multi-head attention mechanisms, ensuring integrated modalities for enhanced
representations and improved multimodal data analysis. The experiments are
performed using two fake news datasets, Weibo and Gossipcop. The results
indicate TT-BLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

                                        <span>  With the recent advancements in single-image-based human mesh recovery, there
is a growing interest in enhancing its performance in certain extreme
scenarios, such as occlusion, while maintaining overall model accuracy.
Although obtaining accurately annotated 3D human poses under occlusion is
challenging, there is still a wealth of rich and precise 2D pose annotations
that can be leveraged. However, existing works mostly focus on directly
leveraging 2D pose coordinates to estimate 3D pose and mesh. In this paper, we
present PostoMETRO($\textbf{Pos}$e $\textbf{to}$ken enhanced $\textbf{ME}$sh
$\textbf{TR}$ansf$\textbf{O}$rmer), which integrates occlusion-resilient 2D
pose representation into transformers in a token-wise manner. Utilizing a
specialized pose tokenizer, we efficiently condense 2D pose data to a compact
sequence of pose tokens and feed them to the transformer together with the
image tokens. This process not only ensures a rich depiction of texture from
the image but also fosters a robust integration of pose and image information.
Subsequently, these combined tokens are queried by vertex and joint tokens to
decode 3D coordinates of mesh vertices and human joints. Facilitated by the
robust pose token representation and the effective combination, we are able to
produce more precise 3D coordinates, even under extreme scenarios like
occlusion. Experiments on both standard and occlusion-specific benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of PostoMETRO. Qualitative results further
illustrate the clarity of how 2D pose can help 3D reconstruction. Code will be
made available.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a 3D shape completion approach using a 3D latent
diffusion model optimized for completing shapes, represented as Truncated
Signed Distance Functions (TSDFs), from partial 3D scans. Our method combines
image-based conditioning through cross-attention and spatial conditioning
through the integration of 3D features from captured partial scans. This dual
guidance enables high-fidelity, realistic shape completions at superior
resolutions. At the core of our approach is the compression of 3D data into a
low-dimensional latent space using an auto-encoder inspired by 2D latent
diffusion models. This compression facilitates the processing of
higher-resolution shapes and allows us to apply our model across multiple
object classes, a significant improvement over other existing diffusion-based
shape completion methods, which often require a separate diffusion model for
each class. We validated our approach against two common benchmarks in the
field of shape completion, demonstrating competitive performance in terms of
accuracy and realism and performing on par with state-of-the-art methods
despite operating at a higher resolution with a single model for all object
classes. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our model, showcasing its
efficacy in handling diverse shape completion challenges, even on unseen object
classes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

number of objects in an image, neglecting precise positional information. To
bridge this research gap, this paper introduces the novel task of Few-Shot
Object Localization (FSOL), which aims to provide accurate object positional
information. This task achieves generalized object localization by leveraging a
small number of labeled support samples to query the positional information of
objects within corresponding images. To advance this research field, we propose
an innovative high-performance baseline model. Our model integrates a dual-path
feature augmentation module to enhance shape association and gradient
differences between supports and query images, alongside a self-query module
designed to explore the association between feature maps and query images.
Experimental results demonstrate a significant performance improvement of our
approach in the FSOL task, establishing an efficient benchmark for further
research.

organization. Yet, higher spatial resolution increases scan times, to
compensate for the low signal and contrast-to-noise ratio. This work introduces
a deep learning-based 3D super-resolution (SR) method for fMRI. By
incorporating a resolution-agnostic image augmentation framework, our method
adapts to varying voxel sizes without retraining. We apply this innovative
technique to localize fine-scale motion-selective sites in the early visual
areas. Detection of these sites typically requires a resolution higher than 1
mm isotropic, whereas here, we visualize them based on lower resolution (2-3mm
isotropic) fMRI data. Remarkably, the super-resolved fMRI is able to recover
high-frequency detail of the interdigitated organization of these sites
(relative to the color-selective sites), even with training data sourced from
different subjects and experimental paradigms -- including non-visual
resting-state fMRI, underscoring its robustness and versatility. Quantitative
and qualitative results indicate that our method has the potential to enhance
the spatial resolution of fMRI, leading to a drastic reduction in acquisition
time.

                                        <span>  We present DRESS, a large vision language model (LVLM) that innovatively
exploits Natural Language feedback (NLF) from Large Language Models to enhance
its alignment and interactions by addressing two key limitations in the
state-of-the-art LVLMs. First, prior LVLMs generally rely only on the
instruction finetuning stage to enhance alignment with human preferences.
Without incorporating extra feedback, they are still prone to generate
unhelpful, hallucinated, or harmful responses. Second, while the visual
instruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue
format, the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns
are weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To
tackle these, we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types:
critique and refinement. The critique NLF identifies the strengths and
weaknesses of the responses and is used to align the LVLMs with human
preferences. The refinement NLF offers concrete suggestions for improvement and
is adopted to improve the interaction ability of the LVLMs-- which focuses on
LVLMs' ability to refine responses by incorporating feedback in multi-turn
interactions. To address the non-differentiable nature of NLF, we generalize
conditional reinforcement learning for training. Our experimental results
demonstrate that DRESS can generate more helpful (9.76%), honest (11.52%), and
harmless (21.03%) responses, and more effectively learn from feedback during
multi-turn interactions compared to SOTA LVMLs.

                                        <span>  We introduce EscherNet, a multi-view conditioned diffusion model for view
synthesis. EscherNet learns implicit and generative 3D representations coupled
with a specialised camera positional encoding, allowing precise and continuous
relative control of the camera transformation between an arbitrary number of
reference and target views. EscherNet offers exceptional generality,
flexibility, and scalability in view synthesis -- it can generate more than 100
consistent target views simultaneously on a single consumer-grade GPU, despite
being trained with a fixed number of 3 reference views to 3 target views. As a
result, EscherNet not only addresses zero-shot novel view synthesis, but also
naturally unifies single- and multi-image 3D reconstruction, combining these
diverse tasks into a single, cohesive framework. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that EscherNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple
benchmarks, even when compared to methods specifically tailored for each
individual problem. This remarkable versatility opens up new directions for
designing scalable neural architectures for 3D vision. Project page:

                                        <span>  In the field of robotics, event-based cameras are emerging as a promising
low-power alternative to traditional frame-based cameras for capturing
high-speed motion and high dynamic range scenes. This is due to their sparse
and asynchronous event outputs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their
asynchronous event-driven compute, show great potential for extracting the
spatio-temporal features from these event streams. In contrast, the standard
Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) fail to process event data effectively. However,
training SNNs is difficult due to additional trainable parameters (thresholds
and leaks), vanishing spikes at deeper layers, and a non-differentiable binary
activation function. Furthermore, an additional data structure, membrane
potential, responsible for keeping track of temporal information, must be
fetched and updated at every timestep in SNNs. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel SNN-ANN hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of
both. Specifically, we leverage the asynchronous compute capabilities of SNN
layers to effectively extract the input temporal information. Concurrently, the
ANN layers facilitate training and efficient hardware deployment on traditional
machine learning hardware such as GPUs. We provide extensive experimental
analysis for assigning each layer to be spiking or analog, leading to a network
configuration optimized for performance and ease of training. We evaluate our
hybrid architecture for optical flow estimation on DSEC-flow and Multi-Vehicle
Stereo Event-Camera (MVSEC) datasets. On the DSEC-flow dataset, the hybrid
SNN-ANN architecture achieves a 40% reduction in average endpoint error (AEE)
with 22% lower energy consumption compared to Full-SNN, and 48% lower AEE
compared to Full-ANN, while maintaining comparable energy usage.

present our approach for the upcoming 6th Affective Behavior Analysis

expression recognition task, The limited size of the FER dataset poses a
challenge to the expression recognition model's generalization ability,
resulting in subpar recognition performance. To address this problem, we employ
a semi-supervised learning technique to generate expression category
pseudo-labels for unlabeled face data. At the same time, we uniformly sampled
the labeled facial expression samples and implemented a debiased feedback
learning strategy to address the problem of category imbalance in the dataset
and the possible data bias in semi-supervised learning. Moreover, to further
compensate for the limitation and bias of features obtained only from static
images, we introduced a Temporal Encoder to learn and capture temporal
relationships between neighbouring expression image features. In the 6th ABAW
competition, our method achieved outstanding results on the official validation

success in various video tasks. However, most existing methods follow an "adapt
then align" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to model
video-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of the
action labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mapping
from static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we propose
a novel "Align before Adapt" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to video
representation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for each
frame. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware image
embeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, we
feed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries,
which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from a
video to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLP
during adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities.
This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activity
semantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALT
demonstrates competitive performance while maintaining remarkably low
computational costs. In fully supervised experiments, it achieves 88.1% top-1
accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. Moreover, ALT outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and few-shot experiments,
emphasizing its superior generalizability across various learning scenarios.

                                        <span>  With the popularization of AI solutions for image based problems, there has
been a growing concern for both data privacy and acquisition. In a large number
of cases, information is located on separate data silos and it can be difficult
for a developer to consolidate all of it in a fashion that is appropriate for
machine learning model development. Alongside this, a portion of these
localized data regions may not have access to a labelled ground truth. This
indicates that they have the capacity to reach conclusions numerically, but are
not able to assign classifications amid a lack of pertinent information. Such a
determination is often negligible, especially when attempting to develop image
based solutions that often necessitate this capability. With this being the
case, we propose an innovative vertical federated learning (VFL) model
architecture that can operate under this common set of conditions. This is the
first (and currently the only) implementation of a system that can work under
the constraints of a VFL environment and perform image segmentation while
maintaining nominal accuracies. We achieved this by utilizing an FCN that
boasts the ability to operate on federates that lack labelled data and
privately share the respective weights with a central server, that of which
hosts the necessary features for classification. Tests were conducted on the
CamVid dataset in order to determine the impact of heavy feature compression
required for the transfer of information between federates, as well as to reach
nominal conclusions about the overall performance metrics when working under
such constraints.

supervised methods in various imaging inverse problems, paving the way for
learning-based methods in scientific and medical imaging applications where
ground truth data is hard or expensive to obtain. This is the case in magnetic
resonance imaging and computed tomography. These methods critically rely on
invariance to translations and/or rotations of the image distribution to learn
from incomplete measurement data alone. However, existing approaches fail to
obtain competitive performances in the problems of image super-resolution and
deblurring, which play a key role in most imaging systems. In this work, we
show that invariance to translations and rotations is insufficient to learn
from measurements that only contain low-frequency information. Instead, we
propose a new self-supervised approach that leverages the fact that many image
distributions are approximately scale-invariant, and that enables recovering
high-frequency information lost in the measurement process. We demonstrate
throughout a series of experiments on real datasets that the proposed method
outperforms other self-supervised approaches, and obtains performances on par
with fully supervised learning.

autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed
environments. Context information, such as road maps and surrounding agents'
states, provides crucial geometric and semantic information for motion behavior
prediction. To this end, recent works explore two-stage prediction frameworks
where coarse trajectories are first proposed, and then used to select critical
context information for trajectory refinement. However, they either incur a
large amount of computation or bring limited improvement, if not both. In this
paper, we introduce a novel scenario-adaptive refinement strategy, named
SmartRefine, to refine prediction with minimal additional computation.
Specifically, SmartRefine can comprehensively adapt refinement configurations
based on each scenario's properties, and smartly chooses the number of
refinement iterations by introducing a quality score to measure the prediction
quality and remaining refinement potential of each scenario. SmartRefine is
designed as a generic and flexible approach that can be seamlessly integrated
into most state-of-the-art motion prediction models. Experiments on Argoverse
(1 & 2) show that our method consistently improves the prediction accuracy of
multiple state-of-the-art prediction models. Specifically, by adding
SmartRefine to QCNet, we outperform all published ensemble-free works on the
Argoverse 2 leaderboard (single agent track) at submission. Comprehensive
studies are also conducted to ablate design choices and explore the mechanism

                                        <span>  In cross-domain retrieval, a model is required to identify images from the
same semantic category across two visual domains. For instance, given a sketch
of an object, a model needs to retrieve a real image of it from an online
store's catalog. A standard approach for such a problem is learning a feature
space of images where Euclidean distances reflect similarity. Even without
human annotations, which may be expensive to acquire, prior methods function
reasonably well using unlabeled images for training. Our problem constraint
takes this further to scenarios where the two domains do not necessarily share
any common categories in training data. This can occur when the two domains in
question come from different versions of some biometric sensor recording
identities of different people. We posit a simple solution, which is to
generate synthetic data to fill in these missing category examples across
domains. This, we do via category preserving translation of images from one
visual domain to another. We compare approaches specifically trained for this
translation for a pair of domains, as well as those that can use large-scale
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models via prompts, and find that the
latter can generate better replacement synthetic data, leading to more accurate
cross-domain retrieval models. Our best SynCDR model can outperform prior art
by up to 15\%. Code for our work is available at

                                        <span>  Open-domain 3D object synthesis has been lagging behind image synthesis due
to limited data and higher computational complexity. To bridge this gap, recent
works have investigated multi-view diffusion but often fall short in either 3D
consistency, visual quality, or efficiency. This paper proposes MVEdit, which
functions as a 3D counterpart of SDEdit, employing ancestral sampling to
jointly denoise multi-view images and output high-quality textured meshes.
Built on off-the-shelf 2D diffusion models, MVEdit achieves 3D consistency
through a training-free 3D Adapter, which lifts the 2D views of the last
timestep into a coherent 3D representation, then conditions the 2D views of the
next timestep using rendered views, without uncompromising visual quality. With
an inference time of only 2-5 minutes, this framework achieves better trade-off
between quality and speed than score distillation. MVEdit is highly versatile
and extendable, with a wide range of applications including text/image-to-3D
generation, 3D-to-3D editing, and high-quality texture synthesis. In
particular, evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both
image-to-3D and text-guided texture generation tasks. Additionally, we
introduce a method for fine-tuning 2D latent diffusion models on small 3D
datasets with limited resources, enabling fast low-resolution text-to-3D
initialization.

algorithms, particularly for object detection within volumetric 3D images.
Annotated training data is essential for deep learning-based object detection.
However, annotating densely packed objects is time-consuming and costly.
Instead, we suggest training models on individually scanned objects, causing a
domain shift between training and detection data. To address this challenge, we
introduce the BugNIST dataset, comprising 9154 micro-CT volumes of 12 bug types
and 388 volumes of tightly packed bug mixtures. This dataset is characterized
by having objects with the same appearance in the source and target domain,
which is uncommon for other benchmark datasets for domain shift. During
training, individual bug volumes labeled by class are utilized, while testing
employs mixtures with center point annotations and bug type labels. Together
with the dataset, we provide a baseline detection analysis, aiming at advancing
the field of 3D object detection methods.

(MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture
components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the
image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data
choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we
demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of
image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks,
compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the
image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has
substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of
comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we
build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, including both
dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in
pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised
fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to
large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced
in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot
chain-of-thought prompting.

(CD-FSOD), aiming to develop an accurate object detector for novel domains with
minimal labeled examples. While transformer-based open-set detectors, such as
DE-ViT, show promise in traditional few-shot object detection, their
generalization to CD-FSOD remains unclear: 1) can such open-set detection
methods easily generalize to CD-FSOD? 2) If not, how can models be enhanced
when facing huge domain gaps? To answer the first question, we employ measures
including style, inter-class variance (ICV), and indefinable boundaries (IB) to
understand the domain gap. Based on these measures, we establish a new
benchmark named CD-FSOD to evaluate object detection methods, revealing that
most of the current approaches fail to generalize across domains. Technically,
we observe that the performance decline is associated with our proposed
measures: style, ICV, and IB. Consequently, we propose several novel modules to
address these issues. First, the learnable instance features align initial
fixed instances with target categories, enhancing feature distinctiveness.
Second, the instance reweighting module assigns higher importance to
high-quality instances with slight IB. Third, the domain prompter encourages
features resilient to different styles by synthesizing imaginary domains
without altering semantic contents. These techniques collectively contribute to
the development of the Cross-Domain Vision Transformer for CD-FSOD (CD-ViTO),
significantly improving upon the base DE-ViT. Experimental results validate the
efficacy of our model. All datasets, codes, and models will be released to the
community.

reconstruction tasks, including fast MRI and SVCT, which cover anatomical
regions such as the knee, chest, and abdomen, have demonstrated that MambaMIR
and MambaMIR-GAN achieve comparable or superior reconstruction results relative
to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the estimated uncertainty maps offer
further insights into the reliability of the reconstruction quality. The code

behavior. Recently, numerous computer vision methods emerged to automate the
process. However, observing wild species at remote locations remains a
challenging task due to difficult lighting conditions and constraints on power
supply and data storage. Event cameras offer unique advantages for
battery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high
dynamic range capabilities. We use this novel sensor to quantify a behavior in
Chinstrap penguins called ecstatic display. We formulate the problem as a
temporal action detection task, determining the start and end times of the
behavior. For this purpose, we recorded a colony of breeding penguins in
Antarctica for several weeks and labeled event data on 16 nests. The developed
method consists of a generator of candidate time intervals (proposals) and a
classifier of the actions within them. The experiments show that the event
cameras' natural response to motion is effective for continuous behavior
monitoring and detection, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 58% (which
increases to 63% in good weather conditions). The results also demonstrate the
robustness against various lighting conditions contained in the challenging
dataset. The low-power capabilities of the event camera allow it to record
significantly longer than with a conventional camera. This work pioneers the
use of event cameras for remote wildlife observation, opening new
interdisciplinary opportunities. https://tub-rip.github.io/eventpenguins/

                                        <span>  Few-shot learning (FSL), purposing to resolve the problem of data-scarce, has
attracted considerable attention in recent years. A popular FSL framework
contains two phases: (i) the pre-train phase employs the base data to train a
CNN-based feature extractor. (ii) the meta-test phase applies the frozen
feature extractor to novel data (novel data has different categories from base
data) and designs a classifier for recognition. To correct few-shot data
distribution, researchers propose Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning (SSFSL) by
introducing unlabeled data. Although SSFSL has been proved to achieve
outstanding performances in the FSL community, there still exists a fundamental
problem: the pre-trained feature extractor can not adapt to the novel data
flawlessly due to the cross-category setting. Usually, large amounts of noises
are introduced to the novel feature. We dub it as Feature-Extractor-Maladaptive
(FEM) problem. To tackle FEM, we make two efforts in this paper. First, we
propose a novel label prediction method, Isolated Graph Learning (IGL). IGL
introduces the Laplacian operator to encode the raw data to graph space, which
helps reduce the dependence on features when classifying, and then project
graph representation to label space for prediction. The key point is that: IGL
can weaken the negative influence of noise from the feature representation
perspective, and is also flexible to independently complete training and
testing procedures, which is suitable for SSFSL. Second, we propose Graph
Co-Training (GCT) to tackle this challenge from a multi-modal fusion
perspective by extending the proposed IGL to the co-training framework. GCT is
a semi-supervised method that exploits the unlabeled samples with two modal
features to crossly strengthen the IGL classifier.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we address the challenge of image resolution variation for the
Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability,
exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image
sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt
structure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior
knowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete
retraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for
deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this issue as
a length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while
maintaining a consistent patch size for images of different sizes. To this end,
we propose Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's
adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for
structure modifications. Firstly, we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure
consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token
sequence length changes. Secondly, we present a bias-mode attention mask that
allows each token to prioritize neighboring information, mitigating the impact
of untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in two
scenarios: zero-shot and fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation on diverse datasets,
including DIS5K, DUTS, ISIC, COD10K, and COCO, reveals its ability to
significantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting and
achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning. Furthermore, we
propose a generalized model and benchmark, showcasing BA-SAM's generalizability
across all four datasets simultaneously.

autonomous driving datasets, addressing the urgent demand for extensive and
varied data. Due to the limitations in diversity and challenges in handling
lighting conditions, traditional rendering-based methods are increasingly being
supplanted by diffusion-based methods. However, a significant challenge in
diffusion-based methods is ensuring that the generated sensor data preserve
both intra-world consistency and inter-sensor coherence. To address these
challenges, we combine an additional explicit world volume and propose the
World Volume-aware Multi-camera Driving Scene Generator (WoVoGen). This system
is specifically designed to leverage 4D world volume as a foundational element
for video generation. Our model operates in two distinct phases: (i)
envisioning the future 4D temporal world volume based on vehicle control
sequences, and (ii) generating multi-camera videos, informed by this envisioned
4D temporal world volume and sensor interconnectivity. The incorporation of the
4D world volume empowers WoVoGen not only to generate high-quality street-view
videos in response to vehicle control inputs but also to facilitate scene

practical 3D modeling pipelines such as 3D scene creation and rendering. Due to
the technical difficulty, one can only obtain rough 3D models (R3DMs) for most
real objects using existing 3D reconstruction techniques. As a result,
physically-based rendering (PBR) would render low-quality images or videos for
scenes that are constructed by R3DMs. One promising solution would be
representing real-world objects as Neural Fields such as NeRFs, which are able
to generate photo-realistic renderings of an object under desired viewpoints.
However, a drawback is that the synthesized views through Neural Fields
Rendering (NFR) cannot reflect the simulated lighting details on R3DMs in PBR
pipelines, especially when object interactions in the 3D scene creation cause
local shadows. To solve this dilemma, we propose a lighting transfer network
(LighTNet) to bridge NFR and PBR, such that they can benefit from each other.
LighTNet reasons about a simplified image composition model, remedies the
uneven surface issue caused by R3DMs, and is empowered by several
perceptual-motivated constraints and a new Lab angle loss which enhances the
contrast between lighting strength and colors. Comparisons demonstrate that
LighTNet is superior in synthesizing impressive lighting, and is promising in
pushing NFR further in practical 3D modeling workflows.

                                        <span>  Autonomous vehicles are gradually entering city roads today, with the help of
high-definition maps (HDMaps). However, the reliance on HDMaps prevents
autonomous vehicles from stepping into regions without this expensive digital
infrastructure. This fact drives many researchers to study online HDMap
generation algorithms, but the performance of these algorithms at far regions
is still unsatisfying. We present P-MapNet, in which the letter P highlights
the fact that we focus on incorporating map priors to improve model
performance. Specifically, we exploit priors in both SDMap and HDMap. On one
hand, we extract weakly aligned SDMap from OpenStreetMap, and encode it as an
additional conditioning branch. Despite the misalignment challenge, our
attention-based architecture adaptively attends to relevant SDMap skeletons and
significantly improves performance. On the other hand, we exploit a masked
autoencoder to capture the prior distribution of HDMap, which can serve as a
refinement module to mitigate occlusions and artifacts. We benchmark on the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we show
that: (1) our SDMap prior can improve online map generation performance, using
both rasterized (by up to $+18.73$ $\rm mIoU$) and vectorized (by up to $+8.50$
$\rm mAP$) output representations. (2) our HDMap prior can improve map
perceptual metrics by up to $6.34\%$. (3) P-MapNet can be switched into
different inference modes that covers different regions of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off landscape. (4) P-MapNet is a far-seeing solution
that brings larger improvements on longer ranges. Codes and models are publicly

                                        <span>  It is a long-lasting goal to design a generalist-embodied agent that can
follow diverse instructions in human-like ways. However, existing approaches
often fail to steadily follow instructions due to difficulties in understanding
abstract and sequential natural language instructions. To this end, we
introduce MineDreamer, an open-ended embodied agent built upon the challenging
Minecraft simulator with an innovative paradigm that enhances
instruction-following ability in low-level control signal generation.
Specifically, MineDreamer is developed on top of recent advances in Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, and we employ a
Chain-of-Imagination (CoI) mechanism to envision the step-by-step process of
executing instructions and translating imaginations into more precise visual
prompts tailored to the current state; subsequently, the agent generates
keyboard-and-mouse actions to efficiently achieve these imaginations, steadily
following the instructions at each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MineDreamer follows single and multi-step instructions steadily, significantly
outperforming the best generalist agent baseline and nearly doubling its
performance. Moreover, qualitative analysis of the agent's imaginative ability
reveals its generalization and comprehension of the open world.

expensive. To avoid the prohibitive costs of constantly retraining, it is
imperative to \emph{continually} train these models. This problem is
exacerbated by the lack of any large scale continual learning benchmarks or
baselines. We introduce the first set of web-scale Time-Continual (TiC)
benchmarks for training vision-language models: TiC-DataComp, TiC-YFCC, and
TiC-Redcaps. TiC-DataComp, our largest dataset, contains over 12.7B timestamped
image-text pairs spanning 9 years (2014--2022). We first use our benchmarks to
curate various \emph{dynamic} evaluations to measure temporal robustness of
existing models. We show OpenAI's CLIP (trained on data up to 2020) loses
$\approx 8\%$ zero-shot accuracy on our curated retrieval task from 2021--2022
compared with more recently trained models in OpenCLIP repository. We then
study how to efficiently train models on time-continuous data. We demonstrate
that a simple rehearsal-based approach that continues training from the last
checkpoint and replays old data reduces compute by $2.5\times$ when compared to
the standard practice of retraining from scratch. Code is available at

their applicability while not forgetting what they already know. A trend in
this area is to use a mixture-of-expert technique, where different models work
together to solve the task. However, the experts are usually trained all at
once using whole task data, which makes them all prone to forgetting and
increasing computational burden. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel approach named SEED. SEED selects only one, the most optimal expert for a
considered task, and uses data from this task to fine-tune only this expert.
For this purpose, each expert represents each class with a Gaussian
distribution, and the optimal expert is selected based on the similarity of
those distributions. Consequently, SEED increases diversity and heterogeneity
within the experts while maintaining the high stability of this ensemble
method. The extensive experiments demonstrate that SEED achieves
state-of-the-art performance in exemplar-free settings across various
scenarios, showing the potential of expert diversification through data in
continual learning.

Intelligence-Generated Contents (AIGC) have exponentially increased in daily
lives. Among them, Text-to-Video (T2V) generation has received widespread
attention. Though many T2V models have been released for generating high
perceptual quality videos, there is still lack of a method to evaluate the
quality of these videos quantitatively. To solve this issue, we establish the
largest-scale Text-to-Video Quality Assessment DataBase (T2VQA-DB) to date. The
dataset is composed of 10,000 videos generated by 9 different T2V models. We
also conduct a subjective study to obtain each video's corresponding mean
opinion score. Based on T2VQA-DB, we propose a novel transformer-based model
for subjective-aligned Text-to-Video Quality Assessment (T2VQA). The model
extracts features from text-video alignment and video fidelity perspectives,
then it leverages the ability of a large language model to give the prediction
score. Experimental results show that T2VQA outperforms existing T2V metrics
and SOTA video quality assessment models. Quantitative analysis indicates that
T2VQA is capable of giving subjective-align predictions, validating its
effectiveness. The dataset and code will be released at

performance, but they require significantly higher computation costs at
inference time. To avoid these costs, multiple neural networks can be combined
into one by averaging their weights. However, this usually performs
significantly worse than ensembling. Weight averaging is only beneficial when
different enough to benefit from combining them, but similar enough to average
well. Based on this idea, we propose PopulAtion Parameter Averaging (PAPA): a
method that combines the generality of ensembling with the efficiency of weight
averaging. PAPA leverages a population of diverse models (trained on different
data orders, augmentations, and regularizations) while slowly pushing the
weights of the networks toward the population average of the weights. We also
propose PAPA variants (PAPA-all, and PAPA-2) that average weights rarely rather
than continuously; all methods increase generalization, but PAPA tends to

single image, a video, or a random noise. This problem has been formulated as
modeling of an auto-regressive generation, i.e., to regress past frames to
decode future frames. However, such unidirectional generation is highly prone
to motion drifting over time, generating unrealistic human animation with
significant artifacts such as appearance distortion. We claim that
bidirectional temporal modeling enforces temporal coherence on a generative
network by largely suppressing the motion ambiguity of human appearance. To
prove our claim, we design a novel human animation framework using a denoising
diffusion model: a neural network learns to generate the image of a person by
denoising temporal Gaussian noises whose intermediate results are
cross-conditioned bidirectionally between consecutive frames. In the
experiments, our method demonstrates strong performance compared to existing
unidirectional approaches with realistic temporal coherence

prompts has emerged as an effective method to enhance zero-shot recognition
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To obtain these category-specific
prompts, the present methods rely on hand-crafting the prompts to the LLMs for
generating VLM prompts for the downstream tasks. However, this requires
manually composing these task-specific prompts and still, they might not cover
the diverse set of visual concepts and task-specific styles associated with the
categories of interest. To effectively take humans out of the loop and
completely automate the prompt generation process for zero-shot recognition, we
propose Meta-Prompting for Visual Recognition (MPVR). Taking as input only
minimal information about the target task, in the form of its short natural
language description, and a list of associated class labels, MPVR automatically
produces a diverse set of category-specific prompts resulting in a strong
zero-shot classifier. MPVR generalizes effectively across various popular
zero-shot image recognition benchmarks belonging to widely different domains
when tested with multiple LLMs and VLMs. For example, MPVR obtains a zero-shot
recognition improvement over CLIP by up to 19.8% and 18.2% (5.0% and 4.5% on
average over 20 datasets) leveraging GPT and Mixtral LLMs, respectively

extensively investigated. However, existing approaches require prior knowledge
of the degradation type and train a separate model for each, limiting their
practical applications in unpredictable environments. To address this
challenge, we propose a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompted adaptive enhancer,
CPA-Enhancer, for object detection under unknown degradations. Specifically,
CPA-Enhancer progressively adapts its enhancement strategy under the
step-by-step guidance of CoT prompts, that encode degradation-related
information. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first work that exploits
CoT prompting for object detection tasks. Overall, CPA-Enhancer is a
plug-and-play enhancement model that can be integrated into any generic
detectors to achieve substantial gains on degraded images, without knowing the
degradation type priorly. Experimental results demonstrate that CPA-Enhancer
not only sets the new state of the art for object detection but also boosts the
performance of other downstream vision tasks under unknown degradations.

                                        <span>  Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has gained increasing attention in the
community, in which the recently emerged diffusion models (DMs) have
promisingly shown stronger performance than the past approaches. While existing
state-of-the-art DMs are competent to achieve high-resolution video generation,
they may largely suffer from key limitations (e.g., action occurrence
disorders, crude video motions) with respect to the intricate temporal dynamics
modeling, one of the crux of video synthesis. In this work, we investigate
strengthening the awareness of video dynamics for DMs, for high-quality T2V
generation. Inspired by human intuition, we design an innovative dynamic scene
manager (dubbed as Dysen) module, which includes (step-1) extracting from input
text the key actions with proper time-order arrangement, (step-2) transforming
the action schedules into the dynamic scene graph (DSG) representations, and
(step-3) enriching the scenes in the DSG with sufficient and reasonable
details. Taking advantage of the existing powerful LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) via
in-context learning, Dysen realizes (nearly) human-level temporal dynamics
understanding. Finally, the resulting video DSG with rich action scene details
is encoded as fine-grained spatio-temporal features, integrated into the
backbone T2V DM for video generating. Experiments on popular T2V datasets
suggest that our Dysen-VDM consistently outperforms prior arts with significant
margins, especially in scenarios with complex actions. Codes at

the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that enhances interactive image segmentation
performance. SAMAug generates augmented point prompts to provide more
information about the user's intention to SAM. Starting with an initial point
prompt, SAM produces an initial mask, which is then fed into our proposed
SAMAug to generate augmented point prompts. By incorporating these extra
points, SAM can generate augmented segmentation masks based on both the
augmented point prompts and the initial prompt, resulting in improved
segmentation performance. We conducted evaluations using four different point
augmentation strategies: random sampling, sampling based on maximum difference
entropy, maximum distance, and saliency. Experiment results on the COCO,
Fundus, COVID QUEx, and ISIC2018 datasets show that SAMAug can boost SAM's
segmentation results, especially using the maximum distance and saliency.
SAMAug demonstrates the potential of visual prompt augmentation for computer
vision. Codes of SAMAug are available at github.com/yhydhx/SAMAug

issues, which means they are unaware of unseen events or generate text with
incorrect facts owing to outdated/noisy data. To this end, many knowledge
editing approaches for LLMs have emerged -- aiming to subtly inject/edit
updated knowledge or adjust undesired behavior while minimizing the impact on
unrelated inputs. Nevertheless, due to significant differences among various
knowledge editing methods and the variations in task setups, there is no
standard implementation framework available for the community, which hinders
practitioners from applying knowledge editing to applications. To address these
issues, we propose EasyEdit, an easy-to-use knowledge editing framework for
LLMs. It supports various cutting-edge knowledge editing approaches and can be
readily applied to many well-known LLMs such as T5, GPT-J, LlaMA, etc.
Empirically, we report the knowledge editing results on LlaMA-2 with EasyEdit,
demonstrating that knowledge editing surpasses traditional fine-tuning in terms
of reliability and generalization. We have released the source code on GitHub,
along with Google Colab tutorials and comprehensive documentation for beginners
to get started. Besides, we present an online system for real-time knowledge

                                        <span>  This work breaks through the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT)dilemma in prompt tuning,
i.e., the better the tuned model generalizes to the base (or target) task, the
worse it generalizes to new tasks, and vice versa. Specifically, through an
in-depth analysis of the learned features of the base and new tasks, we observe
that the BNT stems from a channel bias issue, i.e., the vast majority of
feature channels are occupied by base-specific knowledge, resulting in the
collapse of taskshared knowledge important to new tasks. To address this, we
propose the Decoupled Prompt Tuning (DePT) framework, which decouples
base-specific knowledge from feature channels into an isolated feature space
during prompt tuning, so as to maximally preserve task-shared knowledge in the
original feature space for achieving better zero-shot generalization on new
tasks. Importantly, our DePT is orthogonal to existing prompt tuning methods,
hence it can improve all of them. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show the
strong flexibility and effectiveness of DePT. Our code and pretrained models
are available at https://github.com/Koorye/DePT.

amount of attention in the simulation and machine learning communities. Since
most physical simulations are based on compute-intensive, iterative
implementations of differential equation systems, a (partial) replacement with
learned, 1-step inference models has the potential for significant speedups in
a wide range of application areas. In this context, we present a novel
benchmark for the evaluation of 1-step generative learning models in terms of
speed and physical correctness. Our Urban Sound Propagation benchmark is based
on the physically complex and practically relevant, yet intuitively easy to
grasp task of modeling the 2d propagation of waves from a sound source in an
urban environment. We provide a dataset with 100k samples, where each sample
consists of pairs of real 2d building maps drawn from OpenStreetmap, a
parameterized sound source, and a simulated ground truth sound propagation for
the given scene. The dataset provides four different simulation tasks with
increasing complexity regarding reflection, diffraction and source variance. A
first baseline evaluation of common generative U-Net, GAN and Diffusion models
shows, that while these models are very well capable of modeling sound
propagations in simple cases, the approximation of sub-systems represented by
higher order equations systematically fails. Information about the dataset,

reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it heavily relies on high-quality
sharp images and accurate camera poses. Numerous approaches have been proposed
to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with motion-blurred images, commonly
encountered in real-world scenarios such as low-light or long-exposure
conditions. However, the implicit representation of NeRF struggles to
accurately recover intricate details from severely motion-blurred images and
cannot achieve real-time rendering. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D
Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time
rendering by explicitly optimizing point clouds as Gaussian spheres.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named BAD-Gaussians (Bundle
Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting), which leverages explicit Gaussian
representation and handles severe motion-blurred images with inaccurate camera
poses to achieve high-quality scene reconstruction. Our method models the
physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and jointly learns
the parameters of Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during
exposure time.
  In our experiments, we demonstrate that BAD-Gaussians not only achieves
superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art deblur neural
rendering methods on both synthetic and real datasets but also enables
real-time rendering capabilities.

of interest among researchers, presenting numerous challenges. Existing methods
are constrained by animating faces with fixed topologies, wherein point-wise
correspondence is established, and the number and order of points remains
consistent across all identities the model can animate. In this work, we
present ScanTalk, a novel framework capable of animating 3D faces in arbitrary
topologies including scanned data. Our approach relies on the DiffusionNet
architecture to overcome the fixed topology constraint, offering promising
avenues for more flexible and realistic 3D animations. By leveraging the power
of DiffusionNet, ScanTalk not only adapts to diverse facial structures but also
maintains fidelity when dealing with scanned data, thereby enhancing the
authenticity and versatility of generated 3D talking heads. Through
comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we validate the
efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its capacity to generate realistic
talking heads comparable to existing techniques. While our primary objective is
to develop a generic method free from topological constraints, all
state-of-the-art methodologies are bound by such limitations. Code for
reproducing our results, and the pre-trained model will be made available.

comprehend and grasp objects based on natural language instructions. While the
ability to understand personal objects like my wallet facilitates more natural
interaction with human users, current LCRG systems only allow generic language
instructions, e.g., the black-colored wallet next to the laptop. To this end,
we introduce a task scenario GraspMine alongside a novel dataset aimed at
pinpointing and grasping personal objects given personal indicators via
learning from a single human-robot interaction, rather than a large labeled
dataset. Our proposed method, Personalized Grasping Agent (PGA), addresses
GraspMine by leveraging the unlabeled image data of the user's environment,
called Reminiscence. Specifically, PGA acquires personal object information by
a user presenting a personal object with its associated indicator, followed by
PGA inspecting the object by rotating it. Based on the acquired information,
PGA pseudo-labels objects in the Reminiscence by our proposed label propagation
algorithm. Harnessing the information acquired from the interactions and the
pseudo-labeled objects in the Reminiscence, PGA adapts the object grounding
model to grasp personal objects. This results in significant efficiency while
previous LCRG systems rely on resource-intensive human annotations --
necessitating hundreds of labeled data to learn my wallet. Moreover, PGA
outperforms baseline methods across all metrics and even shows comparable
performance compared to the fully-supervised method, which learns from 9k
annotated data samples. We further validate PGA's real-world applicability by
employing a physical robot to execute GrsapMine. Code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/JHKim-snu/PGA.

existing methods have largely overlooked the inherent entity-specific context
within radiology reports and the complex cross-modality contextual
relationships between text and images. To close this gap, we propose a novel
Entity-centered Context-aware Medical Vision-language Pre-training (ECAMP)
framework, which is designed to enable a more entity-centered and
context-sensitive interpretation of medical data. Utilizing the recent powerful
large language model, we distill entity-centered context from medical reports,
which enables ECAMP to gain more effective supervision from the text modality.
By further pre-training our model with carefully designed entity-aware,
context-enhanced masked language modeling and context-guided super-resolution
tasks, ECAMP significantly refines the interplay between text and image
modalities, leading to an enhanced ability to extract entity-centered
contextual features. Besides, our proposed multi-scale context fusion design
also improves the semantic integration of both coarse and fine-level image
representations, prompting better performance for multi-scale downstream
applications. Combining these components leads to significant performance leaps
over current state-of-the-art methods and establishes a new standard for
cross-modality learning in medical imaging, whose effectiveness is demonstrated
by our extensive experiments on various tasks including classification,
segmentation, and detection across several public datasets. Code and models are

                                        <span>  Long-horizon dexterous robot manipulation of deformable objects, such as
banana peeling, is a problematic task because of the difficulties in object
modeling and a lack of knowledge about stable and dexterous manipulation
skills. This paper presents a goal-conditioned dual-action (GC-DA) deep
imitation learning (DIL) approach that can learn dexterous manipulation skills
using human demonstration data. Previous DIL methods map the current sensory
input and reactive action, which often fails because of compounding errors in
imitation learning caused by the recurrent computation of actions. The method
predicts reactive action only when the precise manipulation of the target
object is required (local action) and generates the entire trajectory when
precise manipulation is not required (global action). This dual-action
formulation effectively prevents compounding error in the imitation learning
using the trajectory-based global action while responding to unexpected changes
in the target object during the reactive local action. The proposed method was
tested in a real dual-arm robot and successfully accomplished the
banana-peeling task.

                                        <span>  Image codecs are typically optimized to trade-off bitrate \vs distortion
metrics. At low bitrates, this leads to compression artefacts which are easily
perceptible, even when training with perceptual or adversarial losses. To
improve image quality and remove dependency on the bitrate, we propose to
decode with iterative diffusion models. We condition the decoding process on a
vector-quantized image representation, as well as a global image description to
provide additional context. We dub our model PerCo for 'perceptual
compression', and compare it to state-of-the-art codecs at rates from 0.1 down
to 0.003 bits per pixel. The latter rate is more than an order of magnitude
smaller than those considered in most prior work, compressing a 512x768 Kodak
image with less than 153 bytes. Despite this ultra-low bitrate, our approach
maintains the ability to reconstruct realistic images. We find that our model
leads to reconstructions with state-of-the-art visual quality as measured by
FID and KID. As predicted by rate-distortion-perception theory, visual quality
is less dependent on the bitrate than previous methods.

extensive clinical applications in ophthalmology. OCT enables the visualization
of the retinal layers, playing a vital role in the early detection and
monitoring of retinal diseases. OCT uses the principle of light wave
interference to create detailed images of the retinal microstructures, making
it a valuable tool for diagnosing ocular conditions. This work presents an
open-access OCT dataset (OCTDL) comprising over 2000 OCT images labeled
according to disease group and retinal pathology. The dataset consists of OCT
records of patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic
Macular Edema (DME), Epiretinal Membrane (ERM), Retinal Artery Occlusion (RAO),
Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), and Vitreomacular Interface Disease (VID). The
images were acquired with an Optovue Avanti RTVue XR using raster scanning
protocols with dynamic scan length and image resolution. Each retinal b-scan
was acquired by centering on the fovea and interpreted and cataloged by an
experienced retinal specialist. In this work, we applied Deep Learning
classification techniques to this new open-access dataset.

Language Models (MLLMs). However, the creation of high-quality instruction
tuning data presents significant challenges. Prior methods that depended on
GPT-4 for data generation were not only costly but also lacked satisfactory
performance in complex tasks (i.e., grounding-based reasoning tasks). To
address these issues, we developed an innovative data generation pipeline,
Genixer, to generate various high-quality instruction tuning data, including
nine representative tasks, e.g., Common VQA, REC, REG, and PointQ.
Specifically, Genixer provides a unified solution with four key steps for
alleviating the difficulty of data generation: (i) instruction data collection,
(ii) instruction template design, (iii) empowering MLLM, and (iv) data
generation and filtering. Subsequently, the superior qualitative results of our
Genixer demonstrate that current MLLMs have a strong potential to evolve into
powerful data generators. Additionally, to validate the efficacy of generated
data quantitatively, we add the instruction tuning data produced by Genixer
into the training of two representative MLLMs and observe the consistent
improvements on various VQA tasks and multimodal benchmarks.

                                        <span>  Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) extends the scope of
classic RES to refer to multiple objects in one expression or identify the
empty targets absent in the image. GRES poses challenges in modeling the
complex spatial relationships of the instances in the image and identifying
non-existing referents. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently
shown tremendous progress in these complicated vision-language tasks.
Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models, MLLMs are proficient
in understanding contexts with visual inputs. Among them, LISA, as a
representative, adopts a special [SEG] token to prompt a segmentation mask
decoder, e.g., SAM, to enable MLLMs in the RES task. However, existing
solutions to GRES remain unsatisfactory since current segmentation MLLMs cannot
correctly handle the cases where users might reference multiple subjects in a
singular prompt or provide descriptions incongruent with any image target. In
this paper, we propose Generalized Segmentation Vision Assistant (GSVA) to
address this gap. Specifically, GSVA reuses the [SEG] token to prompt the
segmentation model towards supporting multiple mask references simultaneously
and innovatively learns to generate a [REJ] token to reject the null targets
explicitly. Experiments validate GSVA's efficacy in resolving the GRES issue,
marking a notable enhancement and setting a new record on the GRES benchmark
gRefCOCO dataset. GSVA also proves effective across various classic referring
segmentation and comprehension tasks.

vision tasks like SLAM but limits their applicability in highly dynamic scenes.
Since these tasks rely on identifying point correspondences between input
images within the static part of the environment, we propose a graph neural
network-based sparse feature matching network designed to perform robust
matching under challenging conditions while excluding keypoints on moving
objects. We employ a similar scheme of attentional aggregation over graph edges
to enhance keypoint representations as state-of-the-art feature-matching
networks but augment the graph with epipolar and temporal information and
vastly reduce the number of graph edges. Furthermore, we introduce a
self-supervised training scheme to extract pseudo labels for image pairs in
dynamic environments from exclusively unprocessed visual-inertial data. A
series of experiments show the superior performance of our network as it
excludes keypoints on moving objects compared to state-of-the-art feature
matching networks while still achieving similar results regarding conventional
matching metrics. When integrated into a SLAM system, our network significantly
improves performance, especially in highly dynamic scenes.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we present a novel method that facilitates the creation of
vivid 3D Gaussian avatars from monocular video inputs (GVA). Our innovation
lies in addressing the intricate challenges of delivering high-fidelity human
body reconstructions and aligning 3D Gaussians with human skin surfaces
accurately. The key contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we
introduce a pose refinement technique to improve hand and foot pose accuracy by
aligning normal maps and silhouettes. Precise pose is crucial for correct shape
and appearance reconstruction. Secondly, we address the problems of unbalanced
aggregation and initialization bias that previously diminished the quality of
3D Gaussian avatars, through a novel surface-guided re-initialization method
that ensures accurate alignment of 3D Gaussian points with avatar surfaces.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
high-fidelity and vivid 3D Gaussian avatar reconstruction. Extensive
experimental analyses validate the performance qualitatively and
quantitatively, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in
photo-realistic novel view synthesis while offering fine-grained control over
the human body and hand pose. Project page: https://3d-aigc.github.io/GVA/.

remarkable outcomes. However, these approaches rely on the assumption of sharp
input images. When faced with motion blur, existing dynamic NeRF methods often
struggle to generate high-quality novel views. In this paper, we propose
DyBluRF, a dynamic radiance field approach that synthesizes sharp novel views
from a monocular video affected by motion blur. To account for motion blur in
input images, we simultaneously capture the camera trajectory and object
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) trajectories within the scene. Additionally, we
employ a global cross-time rendering approach to ensure consistent temporal
coherence across the entire scene. We curate a dataset comprising diverse
dynamic scenes that are specifically tailored for our task. Experimental
results on our dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in generating sharp novel views from motion-blurred inputs while
maintaining spatial-temporal consistency of the scene.

However, current models often focus on a limited set of tasks, and
generalization abilities of learned representations are unclear. To this end,
we propose the AV-SUPERB benchmark that enables general-purpose evaluation of
unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering
5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing. We evaluate 5 recent
self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all
tasks, emphasizing the need for future study on improving universal model
performance. In addition, we show that representations may be improved with
intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet
serves as a strong intermediate task. We release our benchmark with evaluation
code and a model submission platform to encourage further research in
audio-visual learning.

                                        <span>  The dilemma between plasticity and stability presents a significant challenge
in Incremental Learning (IL), especially in the exemplar-free scenario where
accessing old-task samples is strictly prohibited during the learning of a new
task. A straightforward solution to this issue is learning and storing an
independent model for each task, known as Single Task Learning (STL). Despite
the linear growth in model storage with the number of tasks in STL, we
empirically discover that averaging these model parameters can potentially
preserve knowledge across all tasks. Inspired by this observation, we propose a
Dual-Learner framework with Cumulative Parameter Averaging (DLCPA). DLCPA
employs a dual-learner design: a plastic learner focused on acquiring new-task
knowledge and a stable learner responsible for accumulating all learned
knowledge. The knowledge from the plastic learner is transferred to the stable
learner via cumulative parameter averaging. Additionally, several task-specific
classifiers work in cooperation with the stable learner to yield the final
prediction. Specifically, when learning a new task, these modules are updated
in a cyclic manner: i) the plastic learner is initially optimized using a
self-supervised loss besides the supervised loss to enhance the feature
extraction robustness; ii) the stable learner is then updated with respect to
the plastic learner in a cumulative parameter averaging manner to maintain its
task-wise generalization; iii) the task-specific classifier is accordingly
optimized to align with the stable learner. Experimental results on CIFAR-100
and Tiny-ImageNet show that DLCPA outperforms several state-of-the-art
exemplar-free baselines in both Task-IL and Class-IL settings.

the enhancement domain with the raw domain to yield realistic images. However,
these methods exhibit a pervasive enhancement bias towards the compression
domain, inadvertently regarding it as more realistic than the raw domain. This
bias makes enhanced images closely resemble their compressed counterparts, thus
degrading their perceptual quality. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective method to mitigate this bias and enhance the quality of compressed
images. Our method employs a conditional discriminator with the compressed
image as a key condition, and then incorporates a domain-divergence
regularization to actively distance the enhancement domain from the compression
domain. Through this dual strategy, our method enables the discrimination
against the compression domain, and brings the enhancement domain closer to the
raw domain. Comprehensive quality evaluations confirm the superiority of our
method over other state-of-the-art methods without incurring inference
overheads.

capabilities, which restrict their applicability in representing multiple
scenes using a single model. To address this problem, existing generalizable
NeRF methods simply condition the model on image features. These methods still
struggle to learn precise global representations over diverse scenes since they
lack an effective mechanism for interacting among different points and views.
In this work, we unveil that 3D implicit representation learning can be
significantly improved by mask-based modeling. Specifically, we propose masked
ray and view modeling for generalizable NeRF (MRVM-NeRF), which is a
self-supervised pretraining target to predict complete scene representations
from partially masked features along each ray. With this pretraining target,
MRVM-NeRF enables better use of correlations across different points and views
as the geometry priors, which thereby strengthens the capability of capturing
intricate details within the scenes and boosts the generalization capability
across different scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed MRVM-NeRF on both synthetic and real-world datasets, qualitatively
and quantitatively. Besides, we also conduct experiments to show the
compatibility of our proposed method with various backbones and its superiority
under few-shot cases.

high-quality images, recent studies have attempted to uncover its potential for
adapting the learned semantic knowledge to visual perception tasks. In this
work, instead of translating a generative diffusion model into a visual
perception model, we explore to retain the generative ability with the
perceptive adaptation. To accomplish this, we present Zippo, a unified
framework for zipping the color and transparency distributions into a single
diffusion model by expanding the diffusion latent into a joint representation
of RGB images and alpha mattes. By alternatively selecting one modality as the
condition and then applying the diffusion process to the counterpart modality,
Zippo is capable of generating RGB images from alpha mattes and predicting
transparency from input images. In addition to single-modality prediction, we
propose a modality-aware noise reassignment strategy to further empower Zippo
with jointly generating RGB images and its corresponding alpha mattes under the
text guidance. Our experiments showcase Zippo's ability of efficient
text-conditioned transparent image generation and present plausible results of
Matte-to-RGB and RGB-to-Matte translation.

massive datasets and thus faces the challenges of high computational demands.
Dataset distillation, as a recent emerging strategy, aims to compress
real-world datasets for efficient training. However, this line of research
currently struggle with large-scale and high-resolution datasets, hindering its
practicality and feasibility. To this end, we re-examine the existing dataset
distillation methods and identify three properties required for large-scale
real-world applications, namely, realism, diversity, and efficiency. As a
remedy, we propose RDED, a novel computationally-efficient yet effective data
distillation paradigm, to enable both diversity and realism of the distilled
data. Extensive empirical results over various neural architectures and
datasets demonstrate the advancement of RDED: we can distill the full
ImageNet-1K to a small dataset comprising 10 images per class within 7 minutes,
achieving a notable 42% top-1 accuracy with ResNet-18 on a single RTX-4090 GPU
(while the SOTA only achieves 21% but requires 6 hours).

                                        <span>  Designing an effective representation learning method for multimodal
sentiment analysis tasks is a crucial research direction. The challenge lies in
learning both shared and private information in a complete modal
representation, which is difficult with uniform multimodal labels and a raw
feature fusion approach. In this work, we propose a deep modal shared
information learning module based on the covariance matrix to capture the
shared information between modalities. Additionally, we use a label generation
module based on a self-supervised learning strategy to capture the private
information of the modalities. Our module is plug-and-play in multimodal tasks,
and by changing the parameterization, it can adjust the information exchange
relationship between the modes and learn the private or shared information
between the specified modes. We also employ a multi-task learning strategy to
help the model focus its attention on the modal differentiation training data.
We provide a detailed formulation derivation and feasibility proof for the
design of the deep modal shared information learning module. We conduct
extensive experiments on three common multimodal sentiment analysis baseline
datasets, and the experimental results validate the reliability of our model.
Furthermore, we explore more combinatorial techniques for the use of the
module. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on most of
the metrics of the three public datasets.

                                        <span>  The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a
statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the
Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in
closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and
(2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider
several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the
Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao
distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we
describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the
Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In
particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small
additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and
tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of
Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on
the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry.
Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian
metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher
information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider
elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to
these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao
lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the
Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative
group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the
notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the
Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.

remains challenging given sparsely sampled views (<10). In contrast to existing
approaches that pursue top-down prediction of global parametrizations of camera
extrinsics, we propose a distributed representation of camera pose that treats
a camera as a bundle of rays. This representation allows for a tight coupling
with spatial image features improving pose precision. We observe that this
representation is naturally suited for set-level transformers and develop a
regression-based approach that maps image patches to corresponding rays. To
capture the inherent uncertainties in sparse-view pose inference, we adapt this
approach to learn a denoising diffusion model which allows us to sample
plausible modes while improving performance. Our proposed methods, both
regression- and diffusion-based, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on
camera pose estimation on CO3D while generalizing to unseen object categories
and in-the-wild captures.

semantic features pose significant challenges for conventional Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN)-based methodologies. These challenges are compounded by
the imbalanced nature of skin lesion datasets, which hampers the ability of
models to learn minority class features effectively. Despite augmentation
strategies, such as those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
previous attempts have not fully addressed these complexities. This study
introduces an innovative approach by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
with Capsule Networks to enhance classification performance. GNNs, known for
their proficiency in handling graph-structured data, offer an advanced
mechanism for capturing complex patterns and relationships beyond the
capabilities of traditional CNNs. Capsule Networks further contribute by
providing superior recognition of spatial hierarchies within images. Our
research focuses on evaluating and enhancing the Tiny Pyramid Vision GNN (Tiny
Pyramid ViG) architecture by incorporating it with a Capsule Network. This
hybrid model was applied to the MNIST:HAM10000 dataset, a comprehensive skin
lesion dataset designed for benchmarking classification models. After 75 epochs
of training, our model achieved a significant accuracy improvement, reaching
89.23% and 95.52%, surpassing established benchmarks such as GoogLeNet
(83.94%), InceptionV3 (86.82%), MobileNet V3 (89.87%), EfficientNet-B7
(92.07%), ResNet18 (92.22%), ResNet34 (91.90%), ViT-Base (73.70%), and IRv2-SA
(93.47%) on the same dataset. This outcome underscores the potential of our
approach in overcoming the inherent challenges of skin lesion classification,
contributing to the advancement of image-based diagnosis in dermatology.

                                        <span>  Human motion generation stands as a significant pursuit in generative
computer vision, while achieving long-sequence and efficient motion generation
remains challenging. Recent advancements in state space models (SSMs), notably
Mamba, have showcased considerable promise in long sequence modeling with an
efficient hardware-aware design, which appears to be a promising direction to
build motion generation model upon it. Nevertheless, adapting SSMs to motion
generation faces hurdles since the lack of a specialized design architecture to
model motion sequence. To address these challenges, we propose Motion Mamba, a
simple and efficient approach that presents the pioneering motion generation
model utilized SSMs. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Temporal Mamba
(HTM) block to process temporal data by ensemble varying numbers of isolated
SSM modules across a symmetric U-Net architecture aimed at preserving motion
consistency between frames. We also design a Bidirectional Spatial Mamba (BSM)
block to bidirectionally process latent poses, to enhance accurate motion
generation within a temporal frame. Our proposed method achieves up to 50% FID
improvement and up to 4 times faster on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets
compared to the previous best diffusion-based method, which demonstrates strong
capabilities of high-quality long sequence motion modeling and real-time human
motion generation. See project website

                                        <span>  We have recently seen tremendous progress in realistic text-to-motion
generation. Yet, the existing methods often fail or produce implausible motions
with unseen text inputs, which limits the applications. In this paper, we
present OMG, a novel framework, which enables compelling motion generation from
zero-shot open-vocabulary text prompts. Our key idea is to carefully tailor the
pretrain-then-finetune paradigm into the text-to-motion generation. At the
pre-training stage, our model improves the generation ability by learning the
rich out-of-domain inherent motion traits. To this end, we scale up a large
unconditional diffusion model up to 1B parameters, so as to utilize the massive
unlabeled motion data up to over 20M motion instances. At the subsequent
fine-tuning stage, we introduce motion ControlNet, which incorporates text
prompts as conditioning information, through a trainable copy of the
pre-trained model and the proposed novel Mixture-of-Controllers (MoC) block.
MoC block adaptively recognizes various ranges of the sub-motions with a
cross-attention mechanism and processes them separately with the
text-token-specific experts. Such a design effectively aligns the CLIP token
embeddings of text prompts to various ranges of compact and expressive motion
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OMG achieves significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot text-to-motion
generation. Project page: https://tr3e.github.io/omg-page.

                                        <span>  Occlusion is a common issue in 3D reconstruction from RGB-D videos, often
blocking the complete reconstruction of objects and presenting an ongoing
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, empowered by a 2D
diffusion-based in-painting model, to reconstruct complete surfaces for the
hidden parts of objects. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained diffusion model
to fill in the hidden areas of 2D images. Then we use these in-painted images
to optimize a neural implicit surface representation for each instance for 3D
reconstruction. Since creating the in-painting masks needed for this process is
tricky, we adopt a human-in-the-loop strategy that involves very little human
engagement to generate high-quality masks. Moreover, some parts of objects can
be totally hidden because the videos are usually shot from limited
perspectives. To ensure recovering these invisible areas, we develop a cascaded
network architecture for predicting signed distance field, making use of
different frequency bands of positional encoding and maintaining overall
smoothness. Besides the commonly used rendering loss, Eikonal loss, and
silhouette loss, we adopt a CLIP-based semantic consistency loss to guide the
surface from unseen camera angles. Experiments on ScanNet scenes show that our
proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and completeness in
object-level reconstruction from scene-level RGB-D videos. Code:

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable results in generating high-quality,
diverse, and creative images. However, when it comes to text-based image
generation, they often fail to capture the intended meaning presented in the
text. For instance, a specified object may not be generated, an unnecessary
object may be generated, and an adjective may alter objects it was not intended
to modify. Moreover, we found that relationships indicating possession between
objects are often overlooked. While users' intentions in text are diverse,
existing methods tend to specialize in only some aspects of these. In this
paper, we propose Predicated Diffusion, a unified framework to express users'
intentions. We consider that the root of the above issues lies in the text
encoder, which often focuses only on individual words and neglects the logical
relationships between them. The proposed method does not solely rely on the
text encoder, but instead, represents the intended meaning in the text as
propositions using predicate logic and treats the pixels in the attention maps
as the fuzzy predicates. This enables us to obtain a differentiable loss
function that makes the image fulfill the proposition by minimizing it. When
compared to several existing methods, we demonstrated that Predicated Diffusion
can generate images that are more faithful to various text prompts, as verified
by human evaluators and pretrained image-text models.

including the high computational cost due to the large model scale and
limitations to generalize a pre-trained model with complex physics. We tackle
those challenges by training models directly from the subsurface geometry

to carbon injection and utilize our trained models to inform decision making in
CCS projects.
  We implement multiple models (CNN, ResNet, and ResNetUNet) for static
mechanics problem, which is a image prediction problem. Next, we use the LSTM
and transformer for transient mechanics scenario, which is a video prediction
problem. It shows ResNetUNet outperforms the others thanks to its architecture
in static mechanics problem, and LSTM shows comparable performance to
transformer in transient problem. This report proceeds by outlining our dataset

video, annotating frame-level labels is tedious and difficult. However, it is
relatively easy to annotate sequence-level labels. This kind of coarse
annotations are called as weak labels. However, training a multi-view
video-based action recognition model with weak labels for frame-level
perception is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel learning
framework, where the weak labels are first used to train a multi-view
video-based base model, which is subsequently used for downstream frame-level
perception tasks. The base model is trained to obtain individual latent
embeddings for each view in the multi-view input. For training the model using
the weak labels, we propose a novel latent loss function. We also propose a
model that uses the view-specific latent embeddings for downstream frame-level
action recognition and detection tasks. The proposed framework is evaluated
using the MM Office dataset by comparing several baseline algorithms. The
results show that the proposed base model is effectively trained using weak
labels and the latent embeddings help the downstream models improve accuracy.
