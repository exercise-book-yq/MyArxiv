In contrast, the standard\nAnalog Neural Networks (ANNs) fail to process event data effectively. However,\ntraining SNNs is difficult due to additional trainable parameters (thresholds\nand leaks), vanishing spikes at deeper layers, and a non-differentiable binary\nactivation function. Furthermore, an additional data structure, membrane\npotential, responsible for keeping track of temporal information, must be\nfetched and updated at every timestep in SNNs. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a novel SNN-ANN hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of\nboth. Specifically, we leverage the asynchronous compute capabilities of SNN\nlayers to effectively extract the input temporal information. Concurrently, the\nANN layers facilitate training and efficient hardware deployment on traditional\nmachine learning hardware such as GPUs. We provide extensive experimental\nanalysis for assigning each layer to be spiking or analog, leading to a network\nconfiguration optimized for performance and ease of training. We evaluate our\nhybrid architecture for optical flow estimation on DSEC-flow and Multi-Vehicle\nStereo Event-Camera (MVSEC) datasets. On the DSEC-flow dataset, the hybrid\nSNN-ANN architecture achieves a 40% reduction in average endpoint error (AEE)\nwith 22% lower energy consumption compared to Full-SNN, and 48% lower AEE\ncompared to Full-ANN, while maintaining comparable energy usage.\n","authors":["Shubham Negi","Deepika Sharma","Adarsh Kumar Kosta","Kaushik Roy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02960v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12931v1","updated":"2024-03-19T17:34:27Z","published":"2024-03-19T17:34:27Z","title":"You Only Sample Once: Taming One-Step Text-To-Image Synthesis by\n  Self-Cooperative Diffusion GANs","summary":"  We introduce YOSO, a novel generative model designed for rapid, scalable, and\nhigh-fidelity one-step image synthesis.

To answer the first question, we employ measures\nincluding style, inter-class variance (ICV), and indefinable boundaries (IB) to\nunderstand the domain gap.

However, observing wild species at remote locations remains a\nchallenging task due to difficult lighting conditions and constraints on power\nsupply and data storage. Event cameras offer unique advantages for\nbattery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high\ndynamic range capabilities. We use this novel sensor to quantify a behavior in\nChinstrap penguins called ecstatic display. We formulate the problem as a\ntemporal action detection task, determining the start and end times of the\nbehavior. For this purpose, we recorded a colony of breeding penguins in\nAntarctica for several weeks and labeled event data on 16 nests. The developed\nmethod consists of a generator of candidate time intervals (proposals) and a\nclassifier of the actions within them. The experiments show that the event\ncameras' natural response to motion is effective for continuous behavior\nmonitoring and detection, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 58% (which\nincreases to 63% in good weather conditions). The results also demonstrate the\nrobustness against various lighting conditions contained in the challenging\ndataset.

In this work,\nwe present global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) that achieves\nhigh-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. Our proposed GF-NeRF utilizes a\ntwo-stage (Global and Focal) architecture and a global-guided training\nstrategy.

As a result,\nphysically-based rendering (PBR) would render low-quality images or videos for\nscenes that are constructed by R3DMs. One promising solution would be\nrepresenting real-world objects as Neural Fields such as NeRFs, which are able\nto generate photo-realistic renderings of an object under desired viewpoints.\nHowever, a drawback is that the synthesized views through Neural Fields\nRendering (NFR) cannot reflect the simulated lighting details on R3DMs in PBR\npipelines, especially when object interactions in the 3D scene creation cause\nlocal shadows. To solve this dilemma, we propose a lighting transfer network\n(LighTNet) to bridge NFR and PBR, such that they can benefit from each other.\nLighTNet reasons about a simplified image composition model, remedies the\nuneven surface issue caused by R3DMs, and is empowered by several\nperceptual-motivated constraints and a new Lab angle loss which enhances the\ncontrast between lighting strength and colors.

Most previous works of subgroup discovery make an\nimplicit assumption that models only underperform on a single biased subgroup,\nwhich does not hold on in-the-wild data where multiple biased subgroups exist.\n  In this work, we propose Decomposition, Interpretation, and Mitigation (DIM),\na novel method to address a more challenging but also more practical problem of\ndiscovering multiple biased subgroups in image classifiers. Our approach\ndecomposes the image features into multiple components that represent multiple\nsubgroups.

We further interpret the semantic meaning of each subgroup\ncomponent by generating natural language descriptions using vision-language\nfoundation models. Finally, DIM mitigates multiple biased subgroups\nsimultaneously via two strategies, including the data- and model-centric\nstrategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Breeds datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DIM in discovering and mitigating multiple biased\nsubgroups.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, empowered by a 2D\ndiffusion-based in-painting model, to reconstruct complete surfaces for the\nhidden parts of objects. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained diffusion model\nto fill in the hidden areas of 2D images. Then we use these in-painted images\nto optimize a neural implicit surface representation for each instance for 3D\nreconstruction. Since creating the in-painting masks needed for this process is\ntricky, we adopt a human-in-the-loop strategy that involves very little human\nengagement to generate high-quality masks. Moreover, some parts of objects can\nbe totally hidden because the videos are usually shot from limited\nperspectives.

The proposed model is able to effectively capture the\ninter-modal relationships by computing the cross-attention weights across the\nindividual modalities and the joint representation of the other two modalities.\nTo further improve the inter-modal relationships, the obtained attended\nfeatures of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the cross-modal\nattention to refine the feature representations of the individual modalities.\nIn addition to that, we have used Temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to\ncapture the temporal modeling (intra-modal relationships) of the individual\nmodalities.

The expanding variety of\nPre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for\nspecific tasks. Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is\nselecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely\non the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images.\nIn this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a\nVLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the \"Modality Gap\" -- the disparity in\nVLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable\nsubstitute for images; and the \"Capability Gap\" -- the discrepancy between the\nVLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct\nprediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general\nperformance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the\nnegative impact of these two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to\ncapture the relevance between open-source datasets and target dataset with a\ntransportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics\nof VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging those two\ngaps and enhancing the VLM's capacity estimation for VLM selection.

However, it often suffers inferior performance\ncompared to the feature knowledge distillation. In this paper, we argue that\nexisting logit-based methods may be sub-optimal since they only leverage the\nglobal logit output that couples multiple semantic knowledge. This may transfer\nambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end, we\npropose a simple but effective method, i.e., Scale Decoupled Distillation\n(SDD), for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output\ninto multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for\nthem. This helps the student to mine and inherit fine-grained and unambiguous\nlogit knowledge. Moreover, the decoupled knowledge can be further divided into\nconsistent and complementary logit knowledge that transfers the semantic\ninformation and sample ambiguity, respectively. By increasing the weight of\ncomplementary parts, SDD can guide the student to focus more on ambiguous\nsamples, improving its discrimination ability. Extensive experiments on several\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDD for wide\nteacher-student pairs, especially in the fine-grained classification task.

Previous works adopt the conventional\nclassification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a\nclassifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks\nor classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding\nto one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters\nof a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains\nall historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually\nrequired to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic\nforgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named\nAttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.\nSpecifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model\nCLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from\nboth images and text. Text consists of a category name and a fixed number of\nlearnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute word bank\nand serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for\nclassification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts,\nwhich encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively\nmitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory.

We point out that MiO\nIR faces two pivotal challenges: the optimization of diverse objectives and the\nadaptation to multiple tasks. To tackle these challenges, we present two simple\nyet effective strategies. The first strategy, referred to as sequential\nlearning, attempts to address how to optimize the diverse objectives, which\nguides the network to incrementally learn individual IR tasks in a sequential\nmanner rather than mixing them together. The second strategy, i.e., prompt\nlearning, attempts to address how to adapt to the different IR tasks, which\nassists the network to understand the specific task and improves the\ngeneralization ability. By evaluating on 19 test sets, we demonstrate that the\nsequential and prompt learning strategies can significantly enhance the MiO\nperformance of commonly used CNN and Transformer backbones. Our experiments\nalso reveal that the two strategies can supplement each other to learn better\ndegradation representations and enhance the model robustness.

One natural\nsolution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner\nwhere each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and\npreviously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering\nworks like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition.\nHowever, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps\nare independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single\nlinear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They\ndominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training\nMLPs compared to autoregressive networks.\n  In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion\nforecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a\nunified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible.\nHowever, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units\n-words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal\nand semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized\nattention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and\ndifferent position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding\nthe transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while\nadopting RoPE for temporal relativity.

These degradations typically\narise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient\nconditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous\nspecialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific\ntype of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant\nattention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model\nwithout requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However,\nthese methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the\ndistinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To\naddress this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network\nbased on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that different degradation types impact the image content on\ndifferent frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each\nrestoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency\ninformation from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra\nof the degraded image.

Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input\nfor a progressively guided restoration.

To address this, we make use of the relations between the\nunorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual\ninformation for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context\n(HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces\na binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us\nto unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully\ndesigned context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian\ndistributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized\nattribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable\nhigh-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity\nrestoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to\neliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer\nto explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a\nremarkable size reduction of over $75\\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while\nsimultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\\times$ size reduction\nover SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS.

Specifically, to reconstruct the entire colon in a piecewise\nmanner, our ColonNeRF introduces a region division and integration module,\neffectively reducing shape dissimilarity and ensuring geometric consistency in\neach segment. To learn both the simple and complex geometry in a unified\nframework, our ColonNeRF incorporates a multi-level fusion module that\nprogressively models the colon regions from easy to hard. Additionally, to\novercome the challenges from sparse views, we devise a DensiNet module for\ndensifying camera poses under the guidance of semantic consistency. We conduct\nextensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate our\nColonNeRF. Quantitatively, ColonNeRF exhibits a 67%-85% increase in LPIPS-ALEX\nscores.

In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel\ntraining-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary\nsteps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.\nInstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an\nexisting image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion\nand feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing\nimage editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.\nBeyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support\nnovel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,\nsubject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by\nprevious methods.

Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which\nallows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image\ngeneration and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream\ntask, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to\nextract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges\nstyle information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the\ngeneration of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging\nstyles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work,\nwe use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of\nour method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further\ndemonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge\nabout tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic\nimages with known layouts. This allows us to generate additional synthetic data\nto train a segmentation network in a semi-supervised fashion. We verify the\nadded value of the generated images by showing improved segmentation results\nand lower performance variability between patients when synthetic images are\nincluded during segmentation training.

In the image space, we propose to 'separate' the\nco-occurring objects with image decomposition by subdividing images into\npatches. Importantly, we assign each patch a category tag from Class Activation\nMaps (CAMs), which spatially helps remove the co-context bias and guide the\nsubsequent representation.

Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by\nperturbing inputs during training, which consequently mandates the retraining\nof the DPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in DPM\nand, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a\nnovel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model. We\nempirically and theoretically show that, during inference, for each backward\ntime step $t$ and corresponding state $\\hat{x}_t$, there might exist another\ntime step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with $\\hat{x}_t$.

Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with\ncompact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or\nquantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly\ntraining the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards\nlow-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the\naccuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution\nkernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we\ntruncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50\npre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

Existing methods either rely on domain\nlabels to align domain-invariant feature spaces, or disentangle generalizable\nfeatures from the whole sample, which inevitably lead to the distortion of\nsemantic feature structures and achieve limited generalization. In this work,\nwe make use of large-scale VLMs like CLIP and leverage the textual feature to\ndynamically adjust the classifier's weights for exploring generalizable visual\nfeatures. Specifically, we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL)\nparadigm for DG FAS, which utilizes two lightweight transformers, namely\nContent Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF), to learn the different\nsemantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of\nlearnable query vectors, respectively. Thus, the generalizable prompt can be\nlearned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is\nintroduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative\nof the content description.

This\nstrategic approach has found increasing popularity due to its potential to\nenhance various aspects of biophotonic imaging. One of the primary motivations\nfor employing this strategy is the pursuit of higher temporal resolution or\nincreased imaging speed, critical for capturing fine dynamic biological\nprocesses. This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware\nrequirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more\naccessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth\nreview of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair\nin their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function,\nsignal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution. By deliberately\ncompromising these metrics, researchers aim to not only recuperate them through\nthe application of deep learning networks, but also bolster in return other\ncrucial parameters, such as the field-of-view, depth-of-field, and\nspace-bandwidth product.

The core of our design is the conventional Iterative Closest Point\n(ICP) algorithm, which aligns the objects over time and outputs the\ncorresponding rigid transformations. Crucially, to aid ICP, we propose a\nhistogram-based initialization that discovers the most likely translation, thus\nproviding a good starting point for ICP. The complete scene flow is then\nrecovered from the rigid transformations. We outperform state-of-the-art\nbaselines, including supervised models, on the Waymo dataset and perform\ncompetitively on Argoverse-v2 and nuScenes. Further, we train a feedforward\nneural network, supervised by the pseudo labels from our model, and achieve top\nperformance among all models capable of real-time inference. We validate the\nadvantage of our model on scene flow estimation with longer temporal gaps, up\nto 0.4 seconds where other models fail to deliver meaningful results.\n","authors":["Yancong Lin","Holger Caesar"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17351v2.pdf","comment":"CVPR 2024, camera-ready.

Despite their\nperformance, because improving performance on new tasks requires task-specific\nknowledge, their adaptation is essential. While labels are needed for the\nadaptation, acquiring them is typically expensive. To overcome this challenge,\nactive learning, a method of achieving a high performance by obtaining labels\nfor a small number of samples from experts, has been studied. Active learning\nprimarily focuses on selecting unlabeled samples for labeling and leveraging\nthem to train models. In this study, we pose the question, \"how can the\npre-trained VLMs be adapted under the active learning framework?\" In response\nto this inquiry, we observe that (1) simply applying a conventional active\nlearning framework to pre-trained VLMs even may degrade performance compared to\nrandom selection because of the class imbalance in labeling candidates, and (2)\nthe knowledge of VLMs can provide hints for achieving the balance before\nlabeling. Based on these observations, we devise a novel active learning\nframework for VLMs, denoted as PCB. To assess the effectiveness of our\napproach, we conduct experiments on seven different real-world datasets, and\nthe results demonstrate that PCB surpasses conventional active learning and\nrandom sampling methods.

However, due to the hearable occluding the ear canal,\nthe in-ear microphone mostly records body-conducted speech, typically suffering\nfrom band-limitation effects and amplification at low frequencies. Since the\nocclusion effect is determined by the ratio between the air-conducted and\nbody-conducted components of own voice, the own voice transfer characteristics\nbetween the outer face of the hearable and the in-ear microphone depend on the\nspeech content and the individual talker. In this paper, we propose a\nspeech-dependent model of the own voice transfer characteristics based on\nphoneme recognition, assuming a linear time-invariant relative transfer\nfunction for each phoneme.

However, recent literature highlights issues with attention\nnetworks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning\ninput sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo,\nGlobal Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address\nthe above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the\nstate-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for\ncomputer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces\nEinstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations\nand uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies\nacross image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms\nexisting SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers.\nNotably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet\nand transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as\ntask learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

While arthroplasty has known several technical\nimprovements, a significant share of patients are still unsatisfied with their\nsurgery. Personalised arthroplasty improves surgical outcomes however current\nsolutions require delays, making it difficult to integrate in clinical routine.\nWe propose a fully automated workflow to design patient-specific implants,\npresented for total knee arthroplasty, the most widely performed arthroplasty\nin the world nowadays.\n  The proposed pipeline first uses artificial neural networks to segment the\nproximal and distal extremities of the femur and tibia. Then the full bones are\nreconstructed using augmented statistical shape models, combining shape and\nlandmarks information. Finally, 77 morphological parameters are computed to\ndesign patient-specific implants. The developed workflow has been trained using\n91 CT scans of lower limb and evaluated on 41 CT scans manually segmented, in\nterms of accuracy and execution time.\n  The workflow accuracy was $0.4\\pm0.2mm$ for the segmentation, $1.2\\pm0.4mm$\nfor the full bones reconstruction, and $2.8\\pm2.2mm$ for the anatomical\nlandmarks determination. The custom implants fitted the patients' anatomy with\n$0.6\\pm0.2mm$ accuracy.

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution\npixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to\nhierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on\nlow-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural\nchoices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions\nsignificantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and\nslow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for\nefficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The\nkey principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during\ntraining, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local\ninteractions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between\ntokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the\nhigh-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this\nstrategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary\nembeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and\nit is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We\napply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data.\nFirst, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with\n2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. Second, we\nconfirm this result on the task of monocular depth prediction. Third, we\nfurther extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD\nimages with an order of magnitude faster inference than the best competitor.\n","authors":["Vincent Leroy","Jerome Revaud","Thomas Lucas","Philippe Weinzaepfel"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00632v2.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11170v2","updated":"2024-03-22T15:31:39Z","published":"2024-01-20T08:46:06Z","title":"Inducing High Energy-Latency of Large Vision-Language Models with\n  Verbose Images","summary":"  Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved exceptional\nperformance across various multi-modal tasks. However, the deployment of VLMs\nnecessitates substantial energy consumption and computational resources. Once\nattackers maliciously induce high energy consumption and latency time\n(energy-latency cost) during inference of VLMs, it will exhaust computational\nresources. In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of\nVLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We\nfind that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated\nby maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose\nverbose images, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to\ninduce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference. Concretely, we design\nthree loss objectives. First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of\nend-of-sequence (EOS) token, where EOS token is a signal for VLMs to stop\ngenerating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity\nloss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the\ndiversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which\ncan break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. Furthermore, a\ntemporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance\nthese losses.

In other words, they are unable to\ngenerate T2I-aligned and semantic-fidelity images for the given prompts with\nother concepts such as scenes (``Eiffel Tower''), actions (``holding a\nbasketball''), and facial attributes (``eyes closed''). In this paper, we focus\non inserting accurate and interactive ID embedding into the Stable Diffusion\nModel for semantic-fidelity personalized generation. We address this challenge\nfrom two perspectives: face-wise region fitting and semantic-fidelity token\noptimization. Specifically, we first visualize the attention overfit problem\nand propose a face-wise attention loss to fit the face region instead of\nentangling ID-unrelated information, such as face layout and background. This\nkey trick significantly enhances the ID accuracy and interactive generative\nability with other existing concepts. Then, we optimize one ID representation\nas multiple per-stage tokens where each token contains two disentangled\nfeatures. This expansion of the textual conditioning space improves\nsemantic-fidelity control. Extensive experiments validate that our results\nexhibit superior ID accuracy, text-based manipulation ability, and\ngeneralization compared to previous methods.\n","authors":["Yang Li","Songlin Yang","Wei Wang","Jing Dong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00631v2.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 16 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15212v1","updated":"2024-03-22T13:55:52Z","published":"2024-03-22T13:55:52Z","title":"GCN-DevLSTM: Path Development for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition","summary":"  Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) in videos is an important but\nchallenging task in computer vision.

In applications such\nas autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are\nusually passed through a \"virtual sensor\" realized by a deep learning model, to\nproduce \"measurements\" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a\ntracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are\naccumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We\nargue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information,\nand therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal\ninformation, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the\nend of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called\nMULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object,\na pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the\ninput buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly\nused lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the\nresulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not\nonly to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct\nmore sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by\nthe pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death\nmodels.

However, its direct adaption in medical image\nsegmentation tasks shows significant performance drops with inferior accuracy\nand unstable results. It may also requires an excessive number of prompt points\nto obtain a reasonable accuracy. For segmenting 3D radiological CT or MRI\nscans, a 2D SAM model has to separately handle hundreds of 2D slices. Although\nquite a few studies explore adapting SAM into medical image volumes, the\nefficiency of 2D adaption methods is unsatisfactory and 3D adaptation methods\nonly capable of segmenting specific organs/tumors. In this work, we propose a\ncomprehensive and scalable 3D SAM model for whole-body CT segmentation, named\nCT-SAM3D. Instead of adapting SAM, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation\nmodel using a (nearly) fully labeled CT dataset. To train CT-SAM3D effectively,\nensuring the model's accurate responses to higher-dimensional spatial prompts\nis crucial, and 3D patch-wise training is required due to GPU memory\nconstraints. For this purpose, we propose two key technical developments: 1) a\nprogressively and spatially aligned prompt encoding method to effectively\nencode click prompts in local 3D space; and 2) a cross-patch prompt learning\nscheme to capture more 3D spatial context, which is beneficial for reducing the\nediting workloads when interactively prompting on large organs.

When it contains only specific types of images, the classifier begins\nto rely on shortcuts - simplistic and erroneous rules for decision-making. This\nleads to high performance on the training dataset but inferior results on new,\nvaried images, as the classifier's generalization capability is reduced. For\nexample, if the images labeled as mustache consist solely of male figures, the\nmodel may inadvertently learn to classify images by gender rather than the\npresence of a mustache. One approach to mitigate such biases is to direct the\nmodel's attention toward the target object's location, usually marked using\nbounding boxes or polygons for annotation. However, collecting such annotations\nrequires substantial time and human effort. Therefore, we propose a novel\npatch-labeling method that integrates AI assistance with crowdsourcing to\ncapture human attention from images, which can be a viable solution for\nmitigating bias. Our method consists of two steps. First, we extract the\napproximate location of a target using a pre-trained saliency detection model\nsupplemented by human verification for accuracy. Then, we determine the\nhuman-attentive area in the image by iteratively dividing the image into\nsmaller patches and employing crowdsourcing to ascertain whether each patch can\nbe classified as the target object. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nmethod in mitigating bias through improved classification accuracy and the\nrefined focus of the model. Also, crowdsourced experiments validate that our\nmethod collects human annotation up to 3.4 times faster than annotating object\nlocations with polygons, significantly reducing the need for human resources.\nWe conclude the paper by discussing the advantages of our method in a\ncrowdsourcing context, mainly focusing on aspects of human errors and\naccessibility.\n","authors":["Minsuk Chang","Seokhyeon Park","Hyeon Jeon","Aeri Cho","Soohyun Lee","Jinwook Seo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15013v1.pdf","comment":"21 pages, 11 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00029v3","updated":"2024-03-22T07:52:28Z","published":"2023-12-29T05:28:35Z","title":"6D-Diff: A Keypoint Diffusion Framework for 6D Object Pose Estimation","summary":"  Estimating the 6D object pose from a single RGB image often involves noise\nand indeterminacy due to challenges such as occlusions and cluttered\nbackgrounds.

Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image\nbackdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a\nfraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images.\nSpecifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to\ndivide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those\nwithout it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part\nto a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target\nmodel after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the\nattacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input\nimage to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the\ntrigger feature as input.

Escaping from this trend,\nthis work explores effective gait representations based on the all-purpose\nknowledge produced by task-agnostic Large Vision Models (LVMs) and proposes a\nsimple yet efficient gait framework, termed BigGait. Specifically, the Gait\nRepresentation Extractor (GRE) within BigGait draws upon design principles from\nestablished gait representations, effectively transforming all-purpose\nknowledge into implicit gait representations without requiring third-party\nsupervision signals. Experiments on CCPG, CAISA-B* and SUSTech1K indicate that\nBigGait significantly outperforms the previous methods in both within-domain\nand cross-domain tasks in most cases, and provides a more practical paradigm\nfor learning the next-generation gait representation.

To do\nthis, video-language models must be able to obtain structured understandings,\nsuch as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions\nand skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel domains. In pursuit\nof this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1)\nstep recognition and (2) intra-video retrieval over a dataset of temporally\nsegmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk\nrecordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to make use of:\n(1) out-of-domain visual information; (2) a high temporal context window; and\n(3) multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) domains. This departs from existing\nbenchmarks for procedural video understanding, which typically deal with short\ncontext lengths and can be solved with a single modality. Spacewalk-18, with\nits inherent multimodal and long-form complexity, exposes the high difficulty\nof task recognition and segmentation. We find that state-of-the-art methods\nperform poorly on our benchmark, but improvements can be obtained by\nincorporating information from longer-range temporal context across different\nmodalities. Our experiments underscore the need to develop new approaches to\nthese tasks.

Today,\nthe principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the\nability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real\nand fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are\nto deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We\nconducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate\npeople were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and\naudiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which\npeople would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions\nand stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used\nin the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.\n  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between\nsynthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance\nworsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic\ncontent, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single\nmodality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to\nbeing fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages\nas compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that\nprior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection\nperformance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly\nsusceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that\nhuman perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an\neffective counterdefense.\n","authors":["Di Cooke","Abigail Edwards","Sophia Barkoff","Kathryn Kelly"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16760v1.pdf","comment":"For study pre-registration, see https://osf.io/fnhr3"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10666v3","updated":"2024-03-25T10:59:04Z","published":"2023-05-18T02:57:54Z","title":"A unified front-end framework for English text-to-speech synthesis","summary":"  The front-end is a critical component of English text-to-speech (TTS)\nsystems, responsible for extracting linguistic features that are essential for\na text-to-speech model to synthesize speech, such as prosodies and phonemes.\nThe English TTS front-end typically consists of a text normalization (TN)\nmodule, a prosody word prosody phrase (PWPP) module, and a grapheme-to-phoneme\n(G2P) module.

However, curbs are difficult to\ndetect due to the complex road environment. This paper introduces CurbNet, a\nnovel framework for curb detection, leveraging point cloud segmentation.\nAddressing the dearth of comprehensive curb datasets and the absence of 3D\nannotations, we have developed the 3D-Curb dataset, encompassing 7,100 frames,\nwhich represents the largest and most categorically diverse collection of curb\npoint clouds currently available. Recognizing that curbs are primarily\ncharacterized by height variations, our approach harnesses spatially-rich 3D\npoint clouds for training. To tackle the challenges presented by the uneven\ndistribution of curb features on the xy-plane and their reliance on z-axis\nhigh-frequency features, we introduce the multi-scale and channel attention\n(MSCA) module, a bespoke solution designed to optimize detection performance.\nMoreover, we propose an adaptive weighted loss function group, specifically\nformulated to counteract the imbalance in the distribution of curb point clouds\nrelative to other categories.

Since it is hard to\nannotate event data, previous approaches rely on event-to-image reconstruction\nto obtain pseudo labels for training. However, this will inevitably introduce\nnoise, and learning from noisy pseudo labels, especially when generated from a\nsingle source, may reinforce the errors. This drawback is also called\nconfirmation bias in pseudo-labeling. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid\npseudo-labeling framework for unsupervised event-based semantic segmentation,\nHPL-ESS, to alleviate the influence of noisy pseudo labels. In particular, we\nfirst employ a plain unsupervised domain adaptation framework as our baseline,\nwhich can generate a set of pseudo labels through self-training. Then, we\nincorporate offline event-to-image reconstruction into the framework, and\nobtain another set of pseudo labels by predicting segmentation maps on the\nreconstructed images. A noisy label learning strategy is designed to mix the\ntwo sets of pseudo labels and enhance the quality.

An\nimportant aspect is their transferability, which refers to their ability to\ndeceive other models, thus enabling attacks in the black-box setting. Though\nvarious methods have been proposed to boost transferability, the performance\nstill falls short compared with white-box attacks. In this work, we observe\nthat existing input transformation based attacks, one of the mainstream\ntransfer-based attacks, result in different attention heatmaps on various\nmodels, which might limit the transferability. We also find that breaking the\nintrinsic relation of the image can disrupt the attention heatmap of the\noriginal image. Based on this finding, we propose a novel input transformation\nbased attack called block shuffle and rotation (BSR).

Empirical\nevaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that BSR could achieve\nsignificantly better transferability than the existing input transformation\nbased methods under single-model and ensemble-model settings.

Various pretext tasks\nhave been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three\ndimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic\nones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views.

The second exploits parallel imaging\nplanes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack.

To reduce costs in practice, low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object\ndetection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However, relying\nsolely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object\ndetection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras\nwith the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable\nmulti-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a\nradar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV).\nSpecifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction.\nRadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section\n(RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based\nencoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features,\nwith an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the\ntwo encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to\nscattering the point feature in BEV. Besides, we present the Cross-Attention\nMulti-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature\nfrom radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism, and then fuse\nthe feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show\nthat RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on\nnuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks.

To enhance dataset\ndiversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process\nprompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across\ndifferent images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making\nprocesses regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial\nrole than intensity. In conclusion, our pipeline not only outperforms\nclassifiers trained on the original dataset but also demonstrates superior\nperformance when encountering unseen datasets.

Recent work on reconstructing\nand statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being\ntopologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D\nrepresentation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin,\nopen, surfaces.

However, large datasets pose storage\nchallenges and contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during\ntraining without impacting the final accuracy of the model. In response to\nthese limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into\na condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged.\nOne crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking\nthe original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if\nthe employed model architecture differs from the model used during\ndistillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images,\ne.g., 128x128 and higher. In this paper, we propose Latent Dataset Distillation\nwith Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with\ndataset distillation to tackle both challenges. LD3M incorporates a novel\ndiffusion process tailored for dataset distillation, which improves the\ngradient norms for learning synthetic images. By adjusting the number of\ndiffusion steps, LD3M also offers a straightforward way of controlling the\ntrade-off between speed and accuracy.

Moreover, transformers-based\nmethods with standard self-attention suffer from quadratic computational\ncomplexity with respect to the image resolution, making them less practical for\nCD tasks with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose an\nefficient change detection framework, ELGC-Net, which leverages rich contextual\ninformation to precisely estimate change regions while reducing the model size.\nOur ELGC-Net comprises a Siamese encoder, fusion modules, and a decoder. The\nfocus of our design is the introduction of an Efficient Local-Global Context\nAggregator module within the encoder, capturing enhanced global context and\nlocal spatial information through a novel pooled-transpose (PT) attention and\ndepthwise convolution, respectively. The PT attention employs pooling\noperations for robust feature extraction and minimizes computational cost with\ntransposed attention. Extensive experiments on three challenging CD datasets\ndemonstrate that ELGC-Net outperforms existing methods. Compared to the recent\ntransformer-based CD approach (ChangeFormer), ELGC-Net achieves a 1.4% gain in\nintersection over union metric on the LEVIR-CD dataset, while significantly\nreducing trainable parameters. Our proposed ELGC-Net sets a new\nstate-of-the-art performance in remote sensing change detection benchmarks.\nFinally, we also introduce ELGC-Net-LW, a lighter variant with significantly\nreduced computational complexity, suitable for resource-constrained settings,\nwhile achieving comparable performance.

Third, we propose\ntwo different guidance schemes to allow more control of the generated motions:\ngrasp guidance and detailed textual guidance. Grasp guidance takes a single\ntarget grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach this grasp at the\nend of the grasping stage, which provides control over the grasping pose.

In this paper, we\nextend auto-regressive models to 3D domains, and seek a stronger ability of 3D\nshape generation by improving auto-regressive models at capacity and\nscalability simultaneously. Firstly, we leverage an ensemble of publicly\navailable 3D datasets to facilitate the training of large-scale models. It\nconsists of a comprehensive collection of approximately 900,000 objects, with\nmultiple properties of meshes, points, voxels, rendered images, and text\ncaptions. This diverse labeled dataset, termed Objaverse-Mix, empowers our\nmodel to learn from a wide range of object variations. However, directly\napplying 3D auto-regression encounters critical challenges of high\ncomputational demands on volumetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order\nalong grid dimensions, resulting in inferior quality of 3D shapes. To this end,\nwe then present a novel framework Argus3D in terms of capacity. Concretely, our\napproach introduces discrete representation learning based on a latent vector\ninstead of volumetric grids, which not only reduces computational costs but\nalso preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distributions\nin a more tractable order.

Traditional\nmethods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution,\nimplying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the\ncopyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by\n\"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models\nthat perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment\nphase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure\nnormal model performance. This process grants copyright holders control over\nauthorization during the deployment phase.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also\ninsufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,\ntherefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being\nassigned no relation as a GT. To address these issues, we propose Groupwise\nQuery Specialization and Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ).

The\nlight transport condition plays an important role in this task since changing\nthe conditions will lead to different imaging models. Existing learning-based\nNLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport\nconditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality\nof the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging\nmethod that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a\nsingle network. We achieve this by inferring a latent light transport\nrepresentation from the projection image and using this representation to\nmodulate the network that reconstructs the hidden image from the projection\nimage. We train a light transport encoder together with a vector quantizer to\nobtain the light transport representation. To further regulate this\nrepresentation, we jointly learn both the reconstruction network and the\nreprojection network during training. A set of light transport modulation\nblocks is used to modulate the two jointly trained networks in a multi-scale\nway. Extensive experiments on a large-scale passive NLOS dataset demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed method.

Existing methods adhering to this constraint\nare prone to catastrophic forgetting, far more so than replay-based techniques\nthat retain access to past samples. In this paper, to solve the exemplar-free\nCIL problem, we propose a Dual-Stream Analytic Learning (DS-AL) approach. The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that the DS-AL, despite being an exemplar-free technique,\ndelivers performance comparable with or better than that of replay-based\nmethods across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and\nImageNet-Full.

However, there is a problem of degrading accuracy\nwhen the data distribution shifts between training and testing. As a solution\nof this problem, Test-time Adaptation~(TTA) has been well studied because of\nits practicality. Although TTA methods increase accuracy under distribution\nshift by updating the model at test time, using high-uncertainty predictions is\nknown to degrade accuracy. Since the input image is the root of the\ndistribution shift, we incorporate a new perspective on enhancing the input\nimage into TTA methods to reduce the prediction's uncertainty. We hypothesize\nthat enhancing the input image reduces prediction's uncertainty and increase\nthe accuracy of TTA methods. On the basis of our hypothesis, we propose a novel\nmethod: Test-time Enhancer and Classifier Adaptation~(TECA). In TECA, the\nclassification model is combined with the image enhancement model that\ntransforms input images into recognition-friendly ones, and these models are\nupdated by existing TTA methods. Furthermore, we found that the prediction from\nthe enhanced image does not always have lower uncertainty than the prediction\nfrom the original image. Thus, we propose logit switching, which compares the\nuncertainty measure of these predictions and outputs the lower one. In our\nexperiments, we evaluate TECA with various TTA methods and show that TECA\nreduces prediction's uncertainty and increases accuracy of TTA methods despite\nhaving no hyperparameters and little parameter overhead.\n","authors":["Shohei Enomoto","Naoya Hasegawa","Kazuki Adachi","Taku Sasaki","Shin'ya Yamaguchi","Satoshi Suzuki","Takeharu Eda"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17423v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted to IJCNN2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16169v2","updated":"2024-03-26T06:39:30Z","published":"2024-03-24T14:24:13Z","title":"Gaze-guided Hand-Object Interaction Synthesis: Benchmark and Method","summary":"  Gaze plays a crucial role in revealing human attention and intention,\nshedding light on the cognitive processes behind human actions. The integration\nof gaze guidance with the dynamics of hand-object interactions boosts the\naccuracy of human motion prediction. However, the lack of datasets that capture\nthe intricate relationship and consistency among gaze, hand, and object\nmovements remains a substantial hurdle. In this paper, we introduce the first\nGaze-guided Hand-Object Interaction dataset, GazeHOI, and present a novel task\nfor synthesizing gaze-guided hand-object interactions. Our dataset, GazeHOI,\nfeatures simultaneous 3D modeling of gaze, hand, and object interactions,\ncomprising 479 sequences with an average duration of 19.1 seconds, 812\nsub-sequences, and 33 objects of various sizes.

Existing motion\nmagnification often fails to improve legibility since the intricate motions\nstill retain complex characteristics even after being magnified, which may\ndistract us from analyzing them. In this work, we focus on improving legibility\nby proposing a new concept, axial motion magnification, which magnifies\ndecomposed motions along the user-specified direction.
